#Aggregate Data Models

**Summary** An aggregate is a collection of related objects that we wish to treat as a unit.

Aggregates form the boundaries for ACID operations with the database. It's possible to ACID within an aggregate.


Relational databases *(SQL)* have no concept of aggregate within their data model, so we call them aggregate-ignorant.

**Metamodel** - The model by which the database organizes data.
