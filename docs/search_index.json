Adding “easy to use” as a checklist item does nothing to improve the situation.\n\nThe people who are most often responsible for creating our digital products rarely take into account the users’ goals, needs, or motivations.\nUvidende omkring slutbrugeren\nDe fleste produkter bliver udviklet uden ordentlig forståelse for brugeren.\nHvorfor skal de vælge vores produkt?\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nConflict of interest:  People who build the products—developers—are often also the people who design them.\n\nManglende designfokus\nUdviklere fokuserer på udviklingen og de teknologiske aspekter. Kontra brugsmønster og design.\n\nDesign is a specialized skill, just like software development. Developers would never ask users to help them code; design problems should be treated no differently.\n\n\nPlanning and designing product behavior\nLige så vel som en arkitekt kræves at forstå, folks brug af et hus. Kræves det at en designer forstår folks brugsmønster af software.\n\nIn the early days of industrial manufacturing, engineering and marketing processes alone were sufficient to produce desirable products: It didn’t take much more than good engineering and reasonable pricing to produce a hammer, diesel engine, or tube of toothpaste that people would readily purchase.\n\nSenere forstod folk så at de var nød til at differencer sig via design.\n\nInteraction design isn’t merely a matter of aesthetic choice; rather, it is based on an understanding of users and cognitive principles.\n\nForståelse for brugerens brugsmønster\n3 overordnede processer skal følges ad\n\nDesirability - Hvad folk have?\nViability - Hvad er holdbart? Hvad kan vi sælge?\nCapability - Kan vi lave det? Teknologi.\n\n\nRecognizing User Goals\nHvad er user goals så?\nUser goals er ofte forskellige fra hvad vi tror.\n\nProducts designed and built to achieve business goals alone will eventually fail; users’ personal goals need to be addressed. When the design meets the user’s personal goals, business goals are achieved far more e ectively, for reasons we’ll explore in more detail in later chapters.\n\nDårligt design kan:\n\nMake users feel stupid.\nCause users to make big mistakes.\nRequire too much effort to operate effectively.\nDon’t provide an engaging or enjoyable experience.\n\n\nFinally, when companies do focus on the users, they tend to pay too much attention to the tasks users engage in and not enough attention to their goals in performing those tasks.\n\nSoftware kan være godt, men stadig opfattes som dårlig. Hvis bruger oplevelsen er dårlig.\nFokuser på brugerens endelig mål, i stedet for tasks på vejen. Evt. fjern unødige tasks.\nGoals vs tasks and activities\nGoals er slut produktet. Hvor brugeren skal ende.\nTask og activities er skridt, eller betingelser på vejen mod det mål.\n\nGoals motivate people to perform activities; understanding goals allows you to understand your users’ expectations and aspirations, which in turn can help you decide which activities are truly relevant to your design.\n\nUser goal vil derfor muligvis ikke ændres. Men i takt med at teknologien ændres vil task og activities på vejen muligvis ændres.\nRecap\nRejsen fra A til B. Er User goal. I 1950 var task at tage bilen. activity at køre den.\nNu: User goal: det samme. Task og activity er via Fly\nSe på user goals alene, for at optimere rejsen dertil.\nDesigning to meet goals in context\n\nMany designers assume that making user interfaces and product interactions easier to learn should always be a design target.\n\nAndre gange, kan det være med fokus på udførelsen. Fx. Command + Space på Mac til at åbne programmer hurtigt og effektivt. Kontra Launchpad, der fremstår langt flottere og mere tilgængelig.\n\nIf the task is to enter 5,000 names and addresses into a database, a smoothly functioning data-entry application won’t satisfy the user nearly as much as an automated system that extracts the names from the invoicing system.\n\nRecap\nSelv om det er brugerens opgave at fokusere på sine opgaver, er designerens opgave at se ud over den opgave, at identificere, hvem de vigtigste brugere er, og derefter at bestemme, hvad deres mål (User goal) kunne være og hvorfor.\nImplementation Models and Mental Models\nImplementation model\nBrugeren kommer med en model baseret på tidligere erfaring.\nI stedet for at følge brugerens normale tankegang, følger software en helt anden. Hvilket kan skabe en dårlig bruger oplevelse.\n\nBrugeren går ud fra headeren indeholder menu samt logo. Der kan derfor opstå frustration hvis der ikke gør.\n\nMental models/Conceptual model\nBrugeren forholder sig blot til det de ser.\nFor brugeren er der ingen grund til at forstå hvordan en bil fungerer. Men blot speederen, bremsen etc.\n\nThey create a cognitive shorthand for explaining it.  is explanation is powerful enough to cover their interactions with it but doesn’t necessarily reflect its actual inner mechanics.\n\nRecap - Implementation Models and Mental Models\nIn the digital world, however, the differences between a user’s mental model and the implementation model are often quite distinct. We tend to ignore the fact that our cell phone doesn’t work like a landline phone; instead, it is actually a radio transceiver that might swap connections between a half-dozen different cellular base antennas in the course of a two-minute call. Knowing this doesn’t help us understand how to use the phone.\nRepresented models\nDen tredje model - Designerems - represented model\nHvor designeren vælger at repræsentere et programs funktion for brugeren. Donald Norman kalder dette designer's model.\nFor eksempel kan OSX få en netværk server til at fremstå som om det var en lokal disk. Designeren viser dermed ikke det faktum, at den fysiske diskdrev kan være langt væk rent fysisk.\nRecap - De tre modeller\nJo tættere den repræsenterede model leveres til brugerens mentale model, jo lettere vil han kunne bruge og forstå programmet.\n\nImplementation model, mental model, og represented model.\nDen måde udvikleren skal bygge software er ofte dikteret af forskellige tekniske og forretningsmæssige begrænsninger. Den model for, hvordan softwaren rent faktisk virker kaldes implementation model.\nDen måde brugere opfatter de goals, de skal gøre, og hvordan programmet hjælper dem gøre det er deres mentale model. Den er baseret på deres egne ideer om, hvordan de gør dette.\nDen måde designere vælger at repræsentere bearbejdning af ansøgningen til brugeren kaldes represented model.\nDefination:\n\nEn af designerens vigtigste mål bør derfor være at få den repræsenterede model til at passer en brugers mentale model så tæt som muligt. Derfor er det afgørende, at designerne forstår i detaljer, hvordan brugeren tænker. Samt forstår deres software.\n\nGoal-Directed Design\nIndustrien har indset at user research er essentielt.\n\nProblematik: Translating research results into design solutions. Et hundrede siders brugerinterview, er ikke nemt at oversætte til en kravsspecifikation.\n\nTidligere ansås design som et visual facelift af implementation modellen.\nDefination:\nDesign burde:\n\nIdentifies user requirements and defines a detailed plan for the behavior and appearance of products. In other words, design provides true product definition, based on user goals, business needs, and technology constraints.\n\nDesigners as researchers\nHvis design skal være en produkt definition, skal designerens rolle udvides.\nRollerne burde flyde sammen. Samt designerene skal sætte sig i brugerens sted.\n\nInstead, we need an explicit, systematic process to bridge the gap between research and design for de ning user models, establishing design requirements, and translating those into a high-level interaction framework\n\nGoal-directed design process\n\nSe Figur side 55\n\nResearch\nModeling\nRequirements - Kravspecifikation\nFramework - Overliggende platform\nRefinement\nSupport\n\n"},"interface-design/chapter2.html":{"url":"interface-design/chapter2.html","title":"Second Chapter/Kvali/Kvantitativ","keywords":"","body":"Design research - Chapter 2\nKvantitativ vs kvalitativ data i Design Research\nKvantitativ kan kun besvare \"Hvor mange?\", \"Hvor meget?\".\nMenneskers adfærd er for komplekst til at kun defineres via kvantitativ data.\nKvalitativ research (Spørge folk)\nHjælper os med at forstå\n\nBehaviors, attitudes, and aptitudes of potential and existing product users\nTechnical, business, and environmental contexts—the domain—of the product to be\ndesigned\nVocabulary and other social aspects of the domain in question\nHow existing products are used\n\nKvantitativ research (Stats)\nTil at segmentere brugerne\n\nMarket segmentation is a great tool for identifying and quantifying a market opportunity, but it’s an ineffective tool for defining a product that will capitalize on that opportunity.\nKvantitativ data fra fx. analytics.\n\nDifinition:\nKan hjælpe med at fastslå et marked/behov, men ikke hvad det marked mangler.

Discoverability.\nAffordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, and feedback.\nThe conceptual model - Brugerens opfattelse af siden. Den model, han tidligere har fået, ved lignende sider.\nAffordances\nFor an affordance to be perceptible, there is information available such that the actor perceives and can then act upon the existing affordance.\nThe term affordance refers to the relationship between a physical object and a person.\nA chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore, affords sitting.\nRecap: Affordance er ikke en egenskab til ojektet. Affordance er forholdet til brugeren. \nEt glas affords transparency. Det at vand ikke kan flyde igennem, er dernæst en anti-affordance - the prevention of interaction.\nFugle flyver ofte ind i glas, fordi de netop ikke opfatter affordance.\nFalse affordance er et objekt der udtrykker en funktion, men intet kan. Fx. en placebo knap.\nHidden affordance er muligheder ved et objekt, som brugeren ikke ser. Fx at en sko kan åbne en øl. \nTo be effective, affordances and anti- affordances have to be discoverable—perceivable. \nSignifiers\nSignifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both.\nFx. Skub/træk på en dør.\nDe kan ligeledes være utilsigtet, som fx. at følge en sti hvor græsset er trådt ned af folk inden dig.\nEller at der ingen personer står på togstationen - der således indikerer at toget er kørt.\nRecap:\n\nAffordances are the possible interactions between people and the en- vironment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not.\nPerceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.\nSignifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they\nfail to function.\n\nMapping\nForholdet mellem to ting. \nNatural mapping, by which I mean taking advantage of spatial analogies, leads to immediate understanding. For example, to move an object up, move the control up.\nConceptual model\nEn forkert mapping - som her..

Kan blive opfattet som en backseat driver. Der forstyrrer mere end det hjælper.\nBackseat drivers are often correct, but their remarks and comments can be so numerous and continuous that instead of helping, they become an irritating dis- traction. Machines that give too much feedback are like backseat drivers.\nSkab et hieraki i feedbacken.

Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.\nUser control and freedom\nUsers often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked \"emergency exit\" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.\nConsistency and standards\nUsers should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.\nError prevention\nEven better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.\n(Read full article on preventing user errors.)\nRecognition rather than recall\nMinimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.

Allow users to tailor frequent actions.\nAesthetic and minimalist design\nDialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.\nHelp users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors\nError messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.\nHelp and documentation\nEven though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.\n"},"interface-design/wireframe.html":{"url":"interface-design/wireframe.html","title":"Wireframe","keywords":"","body":"Wireframe\nPrioritering af indhold, et overblik uden forstyrrende detaljegrad.\n\nStructure – How will the pieces of this site be put together?

Something like this :\nSELECT members.firstname || ' ' || members.lastname\nAS \"Full Name\"\nFROM borrowings\nINNER JOIN members\nON members.memberid=borrowings.memberid\nINNER JOIN books\nON books.bookid=borrowings.bookid\nWHERE borrowings.bookid IN (SELECT bookid\n  FROM books\n  WHERE stock>(SELECT avg(stock)\n    FROM books))\nGROUP BY members.firstname, members.lastname;\n\nYikes! This would scare any new comer, or even an intermediate developer looking at SQL for the first time. It shouldn't have to be like this.\nIt's always easy to remember something which is intuitive, and through this guide, I hope to ease the barrier of entry for SQL newbies, and even for people who have worked with SQL, but want a fresh perspective.\n\nAll queries used in this post are made for PostgreSQL, although SQL syntax is very similar across databases, so some of these would work on MySQL, or other SQL databases as well\nThe three magic words\nAlthough there are lots of keywords used in SQL, SELECT, FROM, and WHERE are the ones you would be using in almost every query that you make. After reading ahead, you would realize that these key words represent the most fundamental aspect of querying a database, and other, more complex queries are simply extensions of them.\nOur database\nLet's take a look at the sample data we will be using throughout the rest of this article:\n\n\n\nWe have a library, with books and members. We also have another table for borrowings made.\n\nOur \"books\" table has information about the title, author, date of publication, and stock available. Pretty straightforward.\nOur \"members\" table only has the first and last name of all registered members.\nThe \"borrowings\" table has information on the books borrowed by the members. The bookid column refers to the id of the book in the \"books\" table that was borrowed, and the memberid column corresponds to the member in the \"members\" table that borrowed the book. We also have the dates when the books were borrowed, and when they are expected to be returned.\n\n\nSimple Query\nLet's get started with our first query : We want the names and ids of all books written by \"Dan Brown\".\nOur query would be :\nSELECT bookid AS \"id\", title\nFROM books\nWHERE author='Dan Brown';\n\nWhich would give us :\n\n\n\nid\ntitle\n\n\n\n\n2\nThe Lost Symbol\n\n\n4\nInferno\n\n\n\nSimple enough. However, lets try to dissect the query to really understand whats happening.\n\nFROM - Where do we get the data from?\nThis might seem obvious now, but actually matters a lot when we get to joins and subqueries. FROM is there to point our query to its table, the place where it has to look for the data. This table can simply be one that already exists (like the previous example), or a table which we generate through joins or subqueries.\n\nWHERE - What data should we show?\nWHERE, quite simply acts to filter out the rows that we want to show. In our case the only rows we want to consider are those where the value of the author column is \"Dan Brown\"\n\nSELECT - How should we show it?\nNow that we got all the rows we wanted from the table that we wanted, the question that arises is what exactly do we want to show out of the data that we got? In our case we only need the name and id of the book, so that's what we SELECT. We can also rename the columns we want to show with AS.\nIn the end, you can represent the entire query as a simple diagram :\n\n\nJoins\nWe would now like to see the names of all books (not unique) written by \"Dan Brown\" that were borrowed, along with the date of return :\nSELECT books.title AS \"Title\", borrowings.returndate AS \"Return Date\"\nFROM borrowings JOIN books ON borrowings.bookid=books.bookid\nWHERE books.author='Dan Brown';\n\nWhich would give us :\n\n\n\nTitle\nReturn Date\n\n\n\n\nThe Lost Symbol\n2016-03-23 00:00:00\n\n\nInferno\n2016-04-13 00:00:00\n\n\nThe Lost Symbol\n2016-04-19 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\nMost of the query looks similar to our previous example except for the FROM section. What this means is that the table we are querying from ha changed. We are neither querying the \"books\" table nor the \"borrowings\" table. Instead, we are querying a new table formed by joining these two tables.\nborrowings JOIN books ON borrowings.bookid=books.bookid can be considered as another table formed by combining all entries from the books table and the borrowings table, as long as these entries have the same bookid in each table. The resultant table would be :\n\n\nNow, we just query this table like we did in the simple example above. This means that everytime we join a table, we just have to worry about how we join our tables. After that, the query is reduced in complexity to the level of the \"Simple Query\" example.\nLet's try a slightly more complex join where we join 2 tables.\nWe now want the first name and last name of everyone who has borrowed a book written by \"Dan Brown\".\nThis time, we'll take a bottom-up approach to get our result :\n\nStep 1 - Where do we get the data from?\nTo get the result we want, we would have to join the \"member\" table, as well as the \"books\" table with the \"borrowings\" table.\nThe join section of the query would look like :\nborrowings\nJOIN books ON borrowings.bookid=books.bookid\nJOIN members ON members.memberid=borrowings.memberid\n\nThe resulting table would be :\n\n\nStep 2 - What data should we show?\nWe are only concerned with data where the author is \"Dan Brown\"\nWHERE books.author='Dan Brown'\n\n\nStep 3 - How should we show it?\nNow that we got the data we want, we just want to show the first name and the last name of the members who borrowed it :\nSELECT\nmembers.firstname AS \"First Name\",\nmembers.lastname AS \"Last Name\"\n\n\n\nAwesome! Now we just have to combine the 3 components of our query and we get :\nSELECT\nmembers.firstname AS \"First Name\",\nmembers.lastname AS \"Last Name\"\nFROM borrowings\nJOIN books ON borrowings.bookid=books.bookid\nJOIN members ON members.memberid=borrowings.memberid\nWHERE books.author='Dan Brown';\n\nWhich gives us :\n\n\n\nFirst Name\nLast Name\n\n\n\n\nMike\nWillis\n\n\nEllen\nHorton\n\n\nEllen\nHorton\n\n\n\nAwesome! Although, the names are repeating (non-unique). We'll get to solving that in a bit...\n\nAggregations\nIn a nutshell, aggregations are used to convert many rows into a single row. the only thing that changes is the logic used on each column for its aggregation.\nLet's continue with our previous example, where we saw that there were repetitions in the results we got from our query. We know that Ellen Horton borrowed more than one book, but this is not really the best way to show this information. We can write another query :\nSELECT\nmembers.firstname AS \"First Name\",\nmembers.lastname AS \"Last Name\",\ncount(*) AS \"Number of books borrowed\"\nFROM borrowings\nJOIN books ON borrowings.bookid=books.bookid\nJOIN members ON members.memberid=borrowings.memberid\nWHERE books.author='Dan Brown'\nGROUP BY members.firstname, members.lastname;\n\nWhich would give us our required result :\n\n\n\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nNumber of books borrowed\n\n\n\n\nMike\nWillis\n1\n\n\nEllen\nHorton\n2\n\n\n\n\nAlmost all aggregations we do come with the GROUP BY statement. What this does is convert the table otherwise returned by the query into groups of tables. Each group corresponds to a unique value (or group of values) of columns which we specify in the GROUP BY statement.In this example, we are converting the result we got in the previous exercise into groups of rows. We also perform an aggregation in this case count, which converts multiple rows into a single value (which in our case is the number of rows). This value is then attributed to each group.\nEach row in the result represents the aggregated result of each of our groups.\n\nWe can also logically come to the conclusion that all fields in the result must either be specified in the GROUP BY statement, or have an aggregation done on them. This is because all other fields will vary row wise, and if they were SELECTed, we would'nt know which of their possible values to take.\nIn the above example, the count function worked on all rows (since we are only counting the number of rows). Other functions like sum or max, would work on only a specific row. For example, if we want the total stock of all books written by each author, we would query :\nSELECT author, sum(stock)\nFROM books\nGROUP BY author;\n\nAnd get the result :\n\n\n\nauthor\nsum\n\n\n\n\nRobin Sharma\n4\n\n\nDan Brown\n6\n\n\nJohn Green\n3\n\n\nAmish Tripathi\n2\n\n\n\n\nHere the sum function, only works on the stock column, summing all values for each group.\n\nSubqueries\n\nSub queries are regular SQL queries, that are embedded inside larger queries.\nThere are 3 different types of subqueries, based on what they return -\n\nTwo-dimensional table\nThese are queries that return more than one column. A good example is the query we performed in the previous aggregation excercise. As a subquery, these simply return another table which can be queried further. From the previous excercise, if we only want the stock of books written by \"Robin Sharma\", one way of getting that result would be to use sub-queries :\nSELECT *\nFROM (SELECT author, sum(stock)\n  FROM books\n  GROUP BY author) AS results\nWHERE author='Robin Sharma';\n\nResult :\n\n\n\nauthor\nsum\n\n\n\n\nRobin Sharma\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nOne-dimensional array\nQueries which return multiple rows of a single column, can be used as arrays, in addition to being used as Two-dimensional tables.\nFor example, lets say we want to get the titles and ids of all books written by an author, whose total stock of books is greater than 3.We can break this down into 2 steps -\n\nGet the list of authors with total stock of books greater than 3. Building on top of our previous example, we can write :\nSELECT author\nFROM (SELECT author, sum(stock)\n  FROM books\n  GROUP BY author) AS results\nWHERE sum > 3;\n\nWhich gives us :\n\n\nauthor\nRobin Sharma\nDan Brown\n\n\nWhich can also be written as : ['Robin Sharma', 'Dan Brown']\n\nWe then use this result in our next query :\nSELECT title, bookid\nFROM books\nWHERE author IN (SELECT author\n  FROM (SELECT author, sum(stock)\n  FROM books\n  GROUP BY author) AS results\n  WHERE sum > 3);\n\nWhich gives us :\n| title                      | bookid |\n| -------------------------- | ------ |\n| The Lost Symbol            | 2      |\n| Who Will Cry When You Die? | 3      |\n| Inferno                    | 4      |\nThis is equivalent to writing :\nSELECT title, bookid\nFROM books\nWHERE author IN ('Robin Sharma', 'Dan Brown');\n\n\n\n\nSingle Values\nThese are queries whose results have only one row and one column. These can be treated as a constant value, and can be used anywhere a value is used, like for comparison operators. They can also be used like two dimensional tables, as well as an array containing 1 element.\nAs an example, let's find out information about all books having stock above the average stock of books present.\nThe average stock can be queried using :\nselect avg(stock) from books;\n\nWhich gives us :\n\navg\n3.000\n\n\nWhich can also be used as the scalar value 3.\nSo now, we can finally write our query :\nSELECT *\nFROM books\nWHERE stock>(SELECT avg(stock) FROM books);\n\nWhich is equivalent to writing :\nSELECT *\nFROM books\nWHERE stock>3.000\n\nAnd which gives us :\n\n\n\nbookid\ntitle\nauthor\npublished\nstock\n\n\n\n\n3\nWho Will Cry When You Die?\nRobin Sharma\n2006-06-15 00:00:00\n4\n\n\n\n\nWrite Operations\nMost of the write operations in a database are pretty straightforward, as compared to the more complex read queries.\n\nUpdate\nThe syntax of UPDATE queries are semantically similar to read queries. The only difference however, is that instead of SELECTing columns from a bunch of rows, we SET those columns instead.\nIf we suddenly lost all of our books written by \"Dan Brown\", we would like to update the stock to make it 0. For this we would write :\nUPDATE books\nSET stock=0\nWHERE author='Dan Brown';\n\nWHERE still performs the same function here, which is that of choosing rows. Instead of SELECT which we used in our read queries, we now use SET. However, now, in addition to mentioning the column names, you also have to mention the new value of the columns in the selected rows as well.\n\n\nDelete\nA DELETE query is simply a SELECT, or an UPDATE query without the column names. Seriously. As in SELECT and UPDATE, the WHERE clause remains as it is, selecting rows to be deleted. Since a delete operation removes an entire row, there is no such thing as specifying column names to delete. Hence is instead of updating the stock to 0, if we just deleted the entries from Dan Brown all together, we would write :\nDELETE FROM books\nWHERE author='Dan Brown';\n\n\nInsert\nPossibly the only outlier from the other query types is the INSERT query. Its format is :\nINSERT INTO x\n  (a,b,c)\nVALUES\n  (x, y, z);\n\nWhere a, b, c are the column names and x, y, and z are the values to be inserted into those columns, in the same order in which they are specified. That's pretty much all there is to it.\nFor a more concrete example, here is the INSERT query to input the entire data of the \"books\" table :\nINSERT INTO books\n  (bookid,title,author,published,stock)\nVALUES\n  (1,'Scion of Ikshvaku','Amish Tripathi','06-22-2015',2),\n  (2,'The Lost Symbol','Dan Brown','07-22-2010',3),\n  (3,'Who Will Cry When You Die?','Robin Sharma','06-15-2006',4),\n  (4,'Inferno','Dan Brown','05-05-2014',3),\n  (5,'The Fault in our Stars','John Green','01-03-2015',3);\n\n\nFeedback\nNow that we have come to the end of the guide, it's time for a small test. Take a look at the first query at the very beginning of this post. Can you try to figure out what it does? Try breaking it down into its SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and subquery components.  \nHere it is written in a more readable way :\nSELECT members.firstname || ' ' || members.lastname AS \"Full Name\"\n\nFROM borrowings\nINNER JOIN members\nON members.memberid=borrowings.memberid\nINNER JOIN books\nON books.bookid=borrowings.bookid\n\nWHERE borrowings.bookid IN (SELECT bookid FROM books WHERE stock>  (SELECT avg(stock) FROM books)  )\n\nGROUP BY members.firstname, members.lastname;\n\nIt's actually the list of all members who borrowed any book with a total stock that was above average.\nResult :\n\nFull Name\nLida Tyler\n\n\n"},"DB/NoSQL/basic-nosql.html":{"url":"DB/NoSQL/basic-nosql.html","title":"NoSQL/JSON","keywords":"","body":"First - JSON\nJSON syntax is a subset of the JavaScript object notation syntax:\n\nData is in name-value pairs  {\n      \"company\": Volkswagen\n  }\n\nData is separated by commas\n  {\n      \"company\": \"Volkswagen\",\n      \"name\": \"Beetle\"\n  }\n\nCurly braces hold objects\n\nSquare brackets hold arrays  {\n      \"company\": \"Volkswagen\",\n      \"Cars\": [{\n          \"Color\": \"Red\",\n          \"Color\": \"Grey\",\n          \"Color\": \"Yellow\"\n      }]\n  }\n\n\nCheatsheet\n$gt:        Greather than\n$gte:        Greather than or equal\n$lt:        Lower than\n$lte:        Lower than or equal\n$all:        All\n$in:        In (in the array)\n$nin        Not in (in the array)\n$ne:        Not equal\nSort\nAppend .sort()\nAppend .sort()\ndb.hooker.find().sort( {number: 1 })\n"},"DB/NoSQL/mongo-notes.html":{"url":"DB/NoSQL/mongo-notes.html","title":"MongoDB Walkthrough","keywords":"","body":"Walkthrough\nGreat page SQL vs. NoSQL\ndb.bibliotek.insert{}\nInsert a variable into a collection.\nvar bog =\n\n{\n    \"ISBN\" : 12.0,\n        \"titel\" : \"Birdsong\",\n        \"forfatter\" : \"Sebastian Faulk\",\n        \"format\" : \"ebog\",\n        \"pris\" : 6.0\n}\n\ndb.bibliotek.insert({bog})\nSave it.

A collection shares enough in common with a traditional table that you can safely think of the two as the same thing. Collections = Table\n\nCollections are made up of zero or more documents. Again, a document can safely be thought of as a row. Documents = row\n\nA document is made up of one or more fields, which you can probably guess are a lot like columns. Field = Columns\n\nIndexes in MongoDB function mostly like regular indexes.\n\nCursors are different than the other five concepts but they are important enough, and often overlooked, that I think they are worthy of their own discussion.  The important thing to understand about cursors is that when you ask MongoDB for data, it returns a pointer to the result set called a cursor, which we can do things to, such as counting or skipping ahead, before actually pulling down data.\n\n\nTo recap, MongoDB is made up of databases which contain collections. A collection is made up of documents. Each document is made up of fields. Collections can be indexed, which improves lookup and sorting performance. Finally, when we get data from MongoDB we do so through a cursor whose actual execution is delayed until necessary.\nTo start Mongo with a db defined. `Mongo database`\nTo clear the terminal window use `cls` acts like clear\nSQL vs Not-Only-SQL\nThe core difference comes from the fact that relational databases define columns at the table level whereas a document-oriented database defines its fields at the document level. That is to say that each document within a collection can have its own unique set of fields.  As such, a collection is a dumbed down container in comparison to a table, while a document has a lot more information than a row.\n\nA collection acts as a container of data.\n\nGlobal commands - help or exit. Commands that you execute against the current database are executed against the db object, such as db.help() or db.stats(). Commands that you execute against a specific collection, which is what we'll be doing a lot of, are executed against the db.COLLECTION_NAME object, such as db.hookers.help() or db.hookers.count().\nA small side note: Because this is a JavaScript shell, if you execute a method and omit the parentheses (), you'll see the method body rather than executing the method.\nFirst we'll use the global use helper to switch databases, so go ahead and enter use learn. It doesn't matter that the database doesn't really exist yet. The first collection that we create will also create the actual learn database. Now that you are inside a database, you can start issuing database commands, like db.getCollectionNames(). If you do so, you should get an empty array ([ ]). Since collections are schema-less, we don't explicitly need to create them. We can simply insert a document into a new collection. To do so, use the insert command, supplying it with the document to insert:\ndb.hookers.insert({name: 'Glitter',\n    gender: 'f', weight: 450})\nResult\n{\n    \"_id\": ObjectId(\"5744a91040765d171766294a\"),\n    \"name\": \"Glitter\",\n    \"gender\": \"f\",\n    \"weight\": 450\n}\nThe above line is executing insert against the hooker collection, passing it a single parameter. Internally MongoDB uses a binary serialized JSON format called BSON. Externally, this means that we use JSON a lot, as is the case with our parameters. If we execute db.getCollectionNames() now, we'll actually see two collections: hookers and system.indexes. The collection system.indexes is created once per database and contains the information on our database's indexes.\nYou can now use the find command against hookers to return a list of documents:\ndb.unicorns.find()\nNotice that, in addition to the data you specified, there's an _id field. Every document must have a unique _id field. You can either generate one yourself or let MongoDB generate a value for you which has the type ObjectId. Most of the time you'll probably want to let MongoDB generate it for you. By default, the _id field is indexed - which explains why the system.indexes collection was created. You can look at system.indexes:\ndb.system.indexes.find()\nWhat you're seeing is the name of the index, the database and collection it was created against and the fields included in the index.\nNow, back to our discussion about schema-less collections. Insert a totally different document into hookers, such as:\ndb.hookers.insert({name: 'Starlight',\n    gender: 'f',\n    home: 'Amsterdam',\n    std: false})\nAnd, again use find to list the documents. Once we know a bit more, we'll discuss this interesting behavior of MongoDB, but hopefully you are starting to understand why the more traditional terminology wasn't a good fit.\nMastering Selectors\nIn addition to the six concepts we've explored, there's one practical aspect of MongoDB you need to have a good grasp of before moving to more advanced topics: query selectors. A MongoDB query selector is like the where clause of an SQL statement. As such, you use it when finding, counting, updating and removing documents from collections. A selector is a JSON object, the simplest of which is {} which matches all documents. If we wanted to find all female hookers, we could use {gender:'f'}.\nBefore delving too deeply into selectors, let's set up some data to play with. First, remove what we've put so far in the hookers collection via: db.hookers.remove({}). Now, issue the following inserts to get some data we can play with (I suggest you copy and paste this):\ndb.hookers.insert({name: 'Horny',\n    dob: new Date(1992,2,13,7,47),\n    loves: ['Sunshine,'Watching TV'],\n    weight: 600,\n    gender: 'f',\n    stds: 3});\ndb.hookers.insert({name: 'Aurora',\n    dob: new Date(1991, 0, 24, 13, 0),\n    loves: ['French', 'Grape fruits'],\n    weight: 450,\n    gender: 'f',\n    stds: 7});\ndb.hookers.insert({name: 'Laila',\n    dob: new Date(1973, 1, 9, 22, 10),\n    loves: ['Anal', 'Redbull'],\n    weight: 984,\n    gender: 'f',\n    stds: 82});\nNow that we have data, we can master selectors. {field: value} is used to find any documents where field is equal to value. {field1: value1, field2: value2} is how we do an and statement. The special $lt, $lte, $gt, $gte and $ne are used for less than, less than or equal, greater than, greater than or equal and not equal operations. For example, to get all male unicorns that weigh more than 700 pounds, we could do:\ndb.hookers.find({gender: 'f',\n    weight: {$gt: 700}})\n/// $ne - not equal\n/// $gte - greater than or equal\ndb.hookers.find({gender: {$ne: 'm'},\n    weight: {$gte: 701}})\nThe $exists operator is used for matching the presence or absence of a field, for example:\ndb.hookers.find({\n    stds: {$exists: false}})\nshould return a single document. The '$in' operator is used for matching one of several values that we pass as an array, for example:\ndb.hookers.find({\n    loves: {$in:['Anal,'Redbull']}})\nIf we want to OR rather than AND several conditions on different fields, we use the $or operator and assign to it an array of selectors we want or'd:\ndb.hookers.find({gender: 'f',\n    $or: [{loves: 'Anal},\n          {weight: {$lt: 500}}]})\nThe above will return all female hookers which either love Anal or weigh less than 500 pounds.\nThere's something pretty neat going on in our last two examples. You might have already noticed, but the loves field is an array. MongoDB supports arrays as first class objects. This is an incredibly handy feature. Once you start using it, you wonder how you ever lived without it. What's more interesting is how easy selecting based on an array value is: {loves: 'watermelon'} will return any document where watermelon is a value of loves.\nToo see more selectors Query Selectors.\nWe've seen how these selectors can be used with the find command. They can also be used with the remove command which we've briefly looked at, the count command, which we haven't looked at but you can probably figure out, and the update command which we'll spend more time with later on.\nThe ObjectId which MongoDB generated for our _id field can be selected like so:\ndb.hookers.find(\n    {_id: ObjectId(\"TheObjectId\")})\nSummary\nWe haven't looked at the update command yet, or some of the fancier things we can do with find. However, we did get MongoDB up and running, looked briefly at the insert and remove commands. We also introduced find and saw what MongoDB selectors were all about.\n"},"DB/NoSQL/chapter2.html":{"url":"DB/NoSQL/chapter2.html","title":"Updating - MongoDB","keywords":"","body":"Updating\nUntil now, we only looked at three of the four CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.\nUpdate: Replace vs $set\nIn its simplest form, update takes two parameters: the selector (where) to use and what updates to apply to fields. If Glitter had gained a bit of weight, you might expect that we should execute:\ndb.hookers.update({name: 'Glitter'},\n    {weight: 590})\nThe updated record\ndb.unicorns.find({name: 'Glitter'})\nYou should discover the first surprise of update. No document is found because the second parameter we supplied didn't have any update operators, and therefore it was used to replace the original document. In other words, the update found a document by name and replaced the entire document with the new document (the second parameter). There is no equivalent functionality to this in SQL's update command. In some situations, this is ideal and can be leveraged for some truly dynamic updates. However, when you want to change the value of one, or a few fields, you must use MongoDB's $set operator. Go ahead and run this update to reset the lost fields:\ndb.hookers.update({weight: 590}, {$set: {\n    name: 'Laila',\n    dob: new Date(1979, 7, 18, 18, 44),\n    loves: ['Snickers'],\n    gender: 'f',\n    stds: 9}})\nThis won't overwrite the new weight since we didn't specify it. Now if we execute:\ndb.hookers.find({name: 'Laila'})\nWe get the expected result. Therefore, the correct way to have updated the weight in the first place is:\ndb.hookers.update({name: 'Laila'},\n    {$set: {weight: 590}})\nUpdate Operators\nIn addition to $set, we can leverage other operators to do some nifty things. All update operators work on fields - so your entire document won't be wiped out. For example, the $inc operator is used to increment a field by a certain positive or negative amount. If Laila, had som unusual tainted customers, we can update her std totals.\ndb.hookers.update({name: 'Laila'},\n    {$inc: {stds: +2}})\nIf Laila suddenly developed a sweet tooth, we could add a value to her loves field via the $push operator:\ndb.hookers.update({name: 'Laila'},\n    {$push: {loves: 'sugar'}})\nThe Update Operators section of the MongoDB manual has more information on the other available update operators.\nUpserts\nOne of the more pleasant surprises of using update is that it fully supports upserts. An upsert updates the document if found or inserts it if not. Upserts are handy to have in certain situations and when you run into one, you'll know it. To enable upserting we pass a third parameter to update {upsert:true}.\nA mundane example is the pimp, trying to monitor the amount of customers. If we wanted to keep an aggregate count in real time, we'd have to see if the record already existed for the hooker, and based on that decide to run an update or insert. With the upsert option omitted (or set to false), executing the following won't do anything:\ndb.hookers.update({name: 'Laila'},\n    {$inc: {customers: 1}});\ndb.hookers.find();\nHowever, if we add the upsert option, the results are quite different:\ndb.hookers.update({name: 'Laila'},\n    {$inc: {customers: 1}}, {upsert:true});\ndb.hookers.find();\nSince no documents exists with a field customers equal to Laila, a new document is inserted. If we execute it a second time, the existing document is updated and customers is incremented to 2.\ndb.hookers.update({name: 'Laila'},\n    {$inc: {customers: 1}}, {upsert:true});\ndb.hookers.find();\nMultiple Updates\nThe final surprise update has to offer is that, by default, it'll update a single document. So far, for the examples we've looked at, this might seem logical. However, if you executed something like:\ndb.hookers.update({},\n    {$set: {vaccinated: true }});\ndb.hookers.find({vaccinated: true});\nYou might expect to find all of your hookers to be vaccinated. To get the behavior you desire, the multi option must be set to true:\ndb.hookers.update({},\n    {$set: {vaccinated: true }},\n    {multi:true});\ndb.hookers.find({vaccinated: true});\nSummary\nThis chapter concluded our introduction to the basic CRUD operations available against a collection. We looked at update in detail and observed three interesting behaviors.\n"},"DB/NoSQL/chapter3.html":{"url":"DB/NoSQL/chapter3.html","title":"Query/Find - MongoDB","keywords":"","body":"Find\nChapter 1 provided a superficial look at the find command. There's more to find than understanding selectors though. We already mentioned that the result from find is a cursor. We'll now look at exactly what this means in more detail.\nField Selection\nBefore we jump into cursors, you should know that find takes a second optional parameter called \"projection\". This parameter is the list of fields we want to retrieve or exclude. For example, we can get all of the hookers names without getting back other fields by executing:\ndb.hookers.find({}, {name: 1});\nBy default, the _id field is always returned. We can explicitly exclude it by specifying {name:1, _id: 0}.\nAside from the _id field, you cannot mix and match inclusion and exclusion. If you think about it, that actually makes sense. You either want to select or exclude one or more fields explicitly.\nOrdering\nA few times now I've mentioned that find returns a cursor whose execution is delayed until needed. However, what you've no doubt observed from the shell is that find executes immediately. This is a behavior of the shell only. We can observe the true behavior of cursors by looking at one of the methods we can chain to find. The first that we'll look at is sort. We specify the fields we want to sort on as a JSON document, using 1 for ascending and -1 for descending. For example:\n//heaviest hookers first\ndb.hookers.find().sort({weight: -1})\n\n//by unicorn name then vampire kills:\ndb.hookers.find().sort({name: 1,\n    vampires: -1})\nAs with a relational database, MongoDB can use an index for sorting. We'll look at indexes in more detail later on. However, you should know that MongoDB limits the size of your sort without an index. That is, if you try to sort a very large result set which can't use an index, you'll get an error. \nPaging\nPaging results can be accomplished via the limit and skip cursor methods. To get the second and third heaviest unicorn, we could do:\ndb.hookers.find()\n    .sort({weight: -1})\n    .limit(2)\n    .skip(1)\nUsing limit in conjunction with sort, can be a way to avoid running into problems when sorting on non-indexed fields.\nCount\nThe shell makes it possible to execute a count directly on a collection, such as:\ndb.hookers.count({customers: {$gt: 50}})\nIn reality, count is actually a cursor method, the shell simply provides a shortcut. Drivers which don't provide such a shortcut need to be executed like this (which will also work in the shell):\ndb.hookers.find({customers: {$gt: 50}})\n    .count()\n"},"DB/NoSQL/chapter4.html":{"url":"DB/NoSQL/chapter4.html","title":"Data Modeling - MongoDB","keywords":"","body":"Data Modeling\nLet's shift gears and have a more abstract conversation about MongoDB. Explaining a few new terms and some new syntax is a trivial task. Having a conversation about modeling with a new paradigm isn't as easy. The truth is that most of us are still finding out what works and what doesn't when it comes to modeling with these new technologies. It's a conversation we can start having, but ultimately you'll have to practice and learn on real code.\nOut of all NoSQL databases, document-oriented databases are probably the most similar to relational databases - at least when it comes to modeling. However, the differences that exist are important.\nNo Joins\nThe first and most fundamental difference that you'll need to get comfortable with is MongoDB's lack of joins. I don't know the specific reason why some type of join syntax isn't supported in MongoDB, but I do know that joins are generally seen as non-scalable. That is, once you start to split your data horizontally, you end up performing your joins on the client (the application server) anyway. Regardless of the reasons, the fact remains that data is relational, and MongoDB doesn't support joins.\nWithout knowing anything else, to live in a join-less world, we have to do joins ourselves within our application's code. Essentially we need to issue a second query to find the relevant data in a second collection. Setting our data up isn't any different than declaring a foreign key in a relational database. Let's give a little less focus to our beautiful unicorns and a bit more time to our employees. The first thing we'll do is create an employee (I'm providing an explicit _id so that we can build coherent examples)\ndb.employees.insert({_id: ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d730\"),\n    name: 'Leto'})\nNow let's add a couple employees and set their manager as Leto:\ndb.employees.insert({_id: ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d731\"),\n    name: 'Duncan',\n    manager: ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d730\")});\ndb.employees.insert({_id: ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d732\"),\n    name: 'Moneo',\n    manager: ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d730\")});\n(It's worth repeating that the _id can be any unique value. Since you'd likely use an ObjectId in real life, we'll use them here as well.)\nOf course, to find all of Leto's employees, one simply executes:\ndb.employees.find({manager: ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d730\")})\nThere's nothing magical here. In the worst cases, most of the time, the lack of join will merely require an extra query (likely indexed).\nArrays and Embedded Documents\nJust because MongoDB doesn't have joins doesn't mean it doesn't have a few tricks up its sleeve. Remember when we saw that MongoDB supports arrays as first class objects of a document? It turns out that this is incredibly handy when dealing with many-to-one or many-to-many relationships. As a simple example, if an employee could have two managers, we could simply store these in an array:\ndb.employees.insert({_id: ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d733\"),\n    name: 'Siona',\n    manager: [ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d730\"),\n    ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d732\")] })\nOf particular interest is that, for some documents, manager can be a scalar value, while for others it can be an array. Our original find query will work for both:\ndb.employees.find({manager: ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d730\")})\nYou'll quickly find that arrays of values are much more convenient to deal with than many-to-many join-tables.\nBesides arrays, MongoDB also supports embedded documents. Go ahead and try inserting a document with a nested document, such as:\ndb.employees.insert({_id: ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d734\"),\n    name: 'Ghanima',\n    family: {mother: 'Chani',\n        father: 'Paul',\n        brother: ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d730\")}})\nIn case you are wondering, embedded documents can be queried using a dot-notation:\ndb.employees.find({\n    'family.mother': 'Chani'})\nWe'll briefly talk about where embedded documents fit and how you should use them.\nCombining the two concepts, we can even embed arrays of documents:\ndb.employees.insert({_id: ObjectId(\n    \"4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d735\"),\n    name: 'Chani',\n    family: [ {relation:'mother',name: 'Chani'},\n        {relation:'father',name: 'Paul'},\n        {relation:'brother', name: 'Duncan'}]})\nDenormalization\nYet another alternative to using joins is to denormalize your data. Historically, denormalization was reserved for performance-sensitive code, or when data should be snapshotted (like in an audit log). However, with the ever-growing popularity of NoSQL, many of which don't have joins, denormalization as part of normal modeling is becoming increasingly common. This doesn't mean you should duplicate every piece of information in every document. However, rather than letting fear of duplicate data drive your design decisions, consider modeling your data based on what information belongs to what document.\nFor example, say you are writing a forum application. The traditional way to associate a specific user with a post is via a userid column within posts. With such a model, you can't display posts without retrieving (joining to) users. A possible alternative is simply to store the name as well as the userid with each post. You could even do so with an embedded document, like user: {id: ObjectId('Something'), name: 'Leto'}. Yes, if you let users change their name, you may have to update each document (which is one multi-update).\nAdjusting to this kind of approach won't come easy to some. In a lot of cases it won't even make sense to do this. Don't be afraid to experiment with this approach though. It's not only suitable in some circumstances, but it can also be the best way to do it.\nWhich Should You Choose?\nArrays of ids can be a useful strategy when dealing with one-to-many or many-to-many scenarios. But more commonly, new developers are left deciding between using embedded documents versus doing \"manual\" referencing.\nFirst, you should know that an individual document is currently limited to 16 megabytes in size. Knowing that documents have a size limit, though quite generous, gives you some idea of how they are intended to be used. At this point, it seems like most developers lean heavily on manual references for most of their relationships. Embedded documents are frequently leveraged, but mostly for smaller pieces of data which we want to always pull with the parent document. A real world example may be to store an addresses documents with each user, something like:\ndb.users.insert({name: 'leto',\n    email: 'leto@dune.gov',\n    addresses: [{street: \"229 W. 43rd St\",\n                city: \"New York\", state:\"NY\",zip:\"10036\"},\n               {street: \"555 University\",\n                city: \"Palo Alto\", state:\"CA\",zip:\"94107\"}]})\nThis doesn't mean you should underestimate the power of embedded documents or write them off as something of minor utility. Having your data model map directly to your objects makes things a lot simpler and often removes the need to join. This is especially true when you consider that MongoDB lets you query and index fields of an embedded documents and arrays.\nFew or Many Collections\nGiven that collections don't enforce any schema, it's entirely possible to build a system using a single collection with a mishmash of documents but it would be a very bad idea.  Most MongoDB systems are laid out somewhat similarly to what you'd find in a relational system, though with fewer collections. In other words, if it would be a table in a relational database, there's a chance it'll be a collection in MongoDB (many-to-many join tables being an important exception as well as tables that exist only to enable one to many relationships with simple entities).\nThe conversation gets even more interesting when you consider embedded documents. The example that frequently comes up is a blog. Should you have a posts collection and a comments collection, or should each post have an array of comments embedded within it? Setting aside the 16MB document size limit for the time being (all of Hamlet is less than 200KB, so just how popular is your blog?), most developers should prefer to separate things out. It's simply cleaner, gives you better performance and more explicit.  MongoDB's flexible schema allows you to combine the two approaches by keeping comments in their own collection but embedding a few comments (maybe the first few) in the blog post to be able to display them with the post.  This follows the principle of keeping together data that you want to get back in one query.\nThere's no hard rule (well, aside from 16MB). Play with different approaches and you'll get a sense of what does and does not feel right.\nIn This Chapter\nOur goal in this chapter was to provide some helpful guidelines for modeling your data in MongoDB, a starting point, if you will. Modeling in a document-oriented system is different, but not too different, than in a relational world. You have more flexibility and one constraint, but for a new system, things tend to fit quite nicely. The only way you can go wrong is by not trying.\n"},"DB/NoSQL/chapter5.html":{"url":"DB/NoSQL/chapter5.html","title":"When to use - MongoDB","keywords":"","body":"When To Use MongoDB\nBy now you should have a feel for where and how MongoDB might fit into your existing system. There are enough new and competing storage technologies that it's easy to get overwhelmed by all of the choices.\nFor me, the most important lesson, which has nothing to do with MongoDB, is that you no longer have to rely on a single solution for dealing with your data. No doubt, a single solution has obvious advantages, and for a lot projects - possibly even most - a single solution is the sensible approach. The idea isn't that you must use different technologies, but rather that you can. Only you know whether the benefits of introducing a new solution outweigh the costs.\nWith that said, I'm hopeful that what you've seen so far has made you see MongoDB as a general solution. It's been mentioned a couple times that document-oriented databases share a lot in common with relational databases. Therefore, rather than tiptoeing around it, let's simply state that MongoDB should be seen as a direct alternative to relational databases. Where one might see Lucene as enhancing a relational database with full text indexing, or Redis as a persistent key-value store, MongoDB is a central repository for your data.\nNotice that I didn't call MongoDB a replacement for relational databases, but rather an alternative. It's a tool that can do what a lot of other tools can do. Some of it MongoDB does better, some of it MongoDB does worse. Let's dissect things a little further.\nFlexible Schema\nAn oft-touted benefit of document-oriented database is that they don't enforce a fixed schema. This makes them much more flexible than traditional database tables. I agree that flexible schema is a nice feature, but not for the main reason most people mention.\nPeople talk about schema-less as though you'll suddenly start storing a crazy mishmash of data. There are domains and data sets which can really be a pain to model using relational databases, but I see those as edge cases. Schema-less is cool, but most of your data is going to be highly structured. It's true that having an occasional mismatch can be handy, especially when you introduce new features, but in reality it's nothing a nullable column probably wouldn't solve just as well.\nFor me, the real benefit of dynamic schema is the lack of setup and the reduced friction with OOP. This is particularly true when you're working with a static language. I've worked with MongoDB in both C# and Ruby, and the difference is striking. Ruby's dynamism and its popular ActiveRecord implementations already reduce much of the object-relational impedance mismatch. That isn't to say MongoDB isn't a good match for Ruby, it really is. Rather, I think most Ruby developers would see MongoDB as an incremental improvement, whereas C# or Java developers would see a fundamental shift in how they interact with their data.\nThink about it from the perspective of a driver developer. You want to save an object? Serialize it to JSON (technically BSON, but close enough) and send it to MongoDB. There is no property mapping or type mapping. This straightforwardness definitely flows to you, the end developer.\nWrites\nOne area where MongoDB can fit a specialized role is in logging. There are two aspects of MongoDB which make writes quite fast. First, you have an option to send a write command and have it return immediately without waiting for the write to be acknowledged. Secondly, you can control the write behavior with respect to data durability. These settings, in addition to specifying how many servers should get your data before being considered successful, are configurable per-write, giving you a great level of control over write performance and data durability.\nIn addition to these performance factors, log data is one of those data sets which can often take advantage of schema-less collections. Finally, MongoDB has something called a capped collection. So far, all of the implicitly created collections we've created are just normal collections. We can create a capped collection by using the db.createCollection command and flagging it as capped:\n//limit our capped collection to 1 megabyte\ndb.createCollection('logs', {capped: true,\n    size: 1048576})\nWhen our capped collection reaches its 1MB limit, old documents are automatically purged. A limit on the number of documents, rather than the size, can be set using max. Capped collections have some interesting properties. For example, you can update a document but it can't change in size. The insertion order is preserved, so you don't need to add an extra index to get proper time-based sorting.  You can \"tail\" a capped collection the way you tail a file in Unix via tail -f  which allows you to get new data as it arrives, without having to re-query it.\nIf you want to \"expire\" your data based on time rather than overall collection size, you can use TTL Indexes where TTL stands for \"time-to-live\".\nDurability\nPrior to version 1.8, MongoDB did not have single-server durability. That is, a server crash would likely result in lost or corrupt data. The solution had always been to run MongoDB in a multi-server setup (MongoDB supports replication). Journaling was one of the major features added in 1.8. Since version 2.0 MongoDB enables journaling by default, which allows fast recovery of the server in case of a crash or abrupt power loss.\nDurability is only mentioned here because a lot has been made around MongoDB's past lack of single-server durability. This'll likely show up in Google searches for some time to come. Information you find about journaling being a missing feature is simply out of date.\nFull Text Search\nTrue full text search capability is a recent addition to MongoDB.  It supports fifteen languages with stemming and stop words. With MongoDB's support for arrays and full text search you will only need to look to other solutions if you need a more powerful and full-featured full text search engine.\nTransactions\nMongoDB doesn't have transactions. It has two alternatives, one which is great but with limited use, and the other that is cumbersome but flexible.\nThe first is its many atomic update operations. These are great, so long as they actually address your problem. We already saw some of the simpler ones, like $inc and $set. There are also commands like findAndModify which can update or delete a document and return it atomically.\nThe second, when atomic operations aren't enough, is to fall back to a two-phase commit. A two-phase commit is to transactions what manual dereferencing is to joins. It's a storage-agnostic solution that you do in code. Two-phase commits are actually quite popular in the relational world as a way to implement transactions across multiple databases. The MongoDB website has an example illustrating the most typical example (a transfer of funds). The general idea is that you store the state of the transaction within the actual document being updated atomically and go through the init-pending-commit/rollback steps manually.\nMongoDB's support for nested documents and flexible schema design makes two-phase commits slightly less painful, but it still isn't a great process, especially when you are just getting started with it.\nData Processing\nBefore version 2.2 MongoDB relied on MapReduce for most data processing jobs. As of 2.2 it has added a powerful feature called  aggregation framework or pipeline, so you'll only need to use MapReduce in rare cases where you need complex functions for aggregations that are not yet supported in the pipeline. In the next chapter we'll look at Aggregation Pipeline and MapReduce in detail. For now you can think of them as feature-rich and different ways to group by (which is an understatement).  For parallel processing of very large data, you may need to rely on something else, such as Hadoop. Thankfully, since the two systems really do complement each other, there's a MongoDB connector for Hadoop.\nOf course, parallelizing data processing isn't something relational databases excel at either. There are plans for future versions of MongoDB to be better at handling very large sets of data.\nGeospatial\nA particularly powerful feature of MongoDB is its support for geospatial indexes. This allows you to store either geoJSON or x and y coordinates within documents and then find documents that are $near a set of coordinates or $within a box or circle. This is a feature best explained via some visual aids, so I invite you to try the 5 minute geospatial interactive tutorial, if you want to learn more.\nTools and Maturity\nYou probably already know the answer to this, but MongoDB is obviously younger than most relational database systems. This is absolutely something you should consider, though how much it matters depends on what you are doing and how you are doing it. Nevertheless, an honest assessment simply can't ignore the fact that MongoDB is younger and the available tooling around isn't great (although the tooling around a lot of very mature relational databases is pretty horrible too!). As an example, the lack of support for base-10 floating point numbers will obviously be a concern (though not necessarily a show-stopper) for systems dealing with money.\nOn the positive side, drivers exist for a great many languages, the protocol is modern and simple, and development is happening at blinding speeds. MongoDB is in production at enough companies that concerns about maturity, while valid, are quickly becoming a thing of the past.\nSummary\nMongoDB, in most cases, can replace a relational database. It's much simpler and straightforward; it's faster and generally imposes fewer restrictions on application developers. The lack of transactions can be a legitimate and serious concern. However, when people ask where does MongoDB sit with respect to the new data storage landscape? the answer is simple: right in the middle.\n"},"DB/NoSQL/chapter6.html":{"url":"DB/NoSQL/chapter6.html","title":"Aggregating","keywords":"","body":"Aggregating Data\nAggregation Pipeline\nAggregation pipeline gives you a way to transform and combine documents in your collection.  You do it by passing the documents through a pipeline that's somewhat analogous to the Unix \"pipe\" where you send output from one command to another to a third, etc.\nThe simplest aggregation you are probably already familiar with is the SQL group by expression.  We already saw the simple count()  method, but what if we want to see how many unicorns are male and how many are female?\ndb.unicorns.aggregate([{$group:{_id:'$gender',\n    total: {$sum:1}}}])\nIn the shell we have the aggregate helper which takes an array of pipeline operators.  For a simple count grouped by something, we only need one such operator and it's called $group.   This is the exact analog of GROUP BY in SQL where we create a new document with _id field indicating what field we are grouping by (here it's gender) and other fields usually getting assigned results of some aggregation, in this case we $sum 1 for each document that matches a particular gender.  You probably noticed that the _id field was assigned '$gender' and not 'gender' - the '$' before a field name indicates that the value of this field from incoming document will be substituted.\nWhat are some of the other pipeline operators that we can use?  The most common one to use before (and frequently after) $group would be $match - this is exactly like the find method and it allows us to aggregate only a matching subset of our documents, or to exclude some documents from our result.\ndb.unicorns.aggregate([{$match: {weight:{$lt:600}}},\n    {$group: {_id:'$gender',  total:{$sum:1},\n      avgVamp:{$avg:'$vampires'}}},\n    {$sort:{avgVamp:-1}} ])\nHere we introduced another pipeline operator $sort which does exactly what you would expect, along with it we also get $skip and $limit.  We also used a $group operator $avg.\nMongoDB arrays are powerful and they don't stop us from being able to aggregate on values that are stored inside of them.  We do need to be able to \"flatten\" them to properly count everything:\ndb.unicorns.aggregate([{$unwind:'$loves'},\n     {$group: {_id:'$loves',  total:{$sum:1},\n     unicorns:{$addToSet:'$name'}}},\n      {$sort:{total:-1}},\n      {$limit:1} ])\nHere we will find out which food item is loved by the most unicorns and we will also get the list of names of all the unicorns that love it.  $sort and $limit in combination allow you to get answers to \"top N\" types of questions.\nThere is another powerful pipeline operator called $project (analogous to the projection we can specify to find) which allows you not just to include certain fields, but to create or calculate new fields based on values in existing fields.  For example, you can use math operators to add together values of several fields before finding out the average, or you can use string operators to create a new field that's a concatenation of some existing fields.\nThis just barely scratches the surface of what you can do with aggregations.  In 2.6 aggregation got more powerful as the aggregate command returns either a cursor to the result set (which you already know how to work with from Chapter 1) or it can write your results into a new collection using the $out pipeline operator.  You can see a lot more examples as well as all of the supported pipeline and expression operators in the MongoDB manual.\nMapReduce\nMapReduce is a two-step approach to data processing. First you map, and then you reduce. The mapping step transforms the inputted documents and emits a key=>value pair (the key and/or value can be complex). Then, key/value pairs are grouped by key, such that values for the same key end up in an array. The reduce gets a key and the array of values emitted for that key, and produces the final result.  The map and reduce functions are written in JavaScript.\nWith MongoDB we use the mapReduce command on a collection. mapReduce takes a map function, a reduce function and an output directive. In our shell we can create and pass a JavaScript function. From most libraries you supply a string of your functions (which is a bit ugly). The third parameter sets additional options, for example we could filter, sort and limit the documents that we want analyzed. We can also supply a finalize method to be applied to the results after the reduce step.\nYou probably won't need to use MapReduce for most of your aggregations, but if you do, you can read more about it on my blog and in MongoDB manual.\nSummary\nIn this chapter we covered MongoDB's aggregation capabilities.  Aggregation Pipeline is relatively simple to write once you understand how it's structured and it's a powerful way to group data. MapReduce is more complicated to understand, but its capabilities can be as boundless as any code you can write in JavaScript.\n"},"DB/NoSQL/chapter7.html":{"url":"DB/NoSQL/chapter7.html","title":"Performance and tools - MongoDb","keywords":"","body":"Performance and Tools\nIn this last chapter, we look at a few performance topics as well as some of the tools available to MongoDB developers. We won't dive deeply into either topic, but we will examine the most important aspects of each.\nIndexes\nAt the very beginning we saw the special system.indexes collection which contains information on all the indexes in our database. Indexes in MongoDB work a lot like indexes in a relational database: they help improve query and sorting performance. Indexes are created via ensureIndex:\n// where \"name\" is the field name\ndb.unicorns.ensureIndex({name: 1});\nAnd dropped via dropIndex:\ndb.unicorns.dropIndex({name: 1});\nA unique index can be created by supplying a second parameter and setting unique to true:\ndb.unicorns.ensureIndex({name: 1},\n    {unique: true});\nIndexes can be created on embedded fields (again, using the dot-notation) and on array fields. We can also create compound indexes:\ndb.unicorns.ensureIndex({name: 1,\n    vampires: -1});\nThe direction of your index (1 for ascending, -1 for descending) doesn't matter for a single key index, but it can make a difference for compound indexes when you are sorting on more than one indexed field.\nThe indexes page has additional information on indexes.\nExplain\nTo see whether or not your queries are using an index, you can use the explain method on a cursor:\ndb.unicorns.find().explain()\nThe output tells us that a BasicCursor was used (which means non-indexed), that 12 objects were scanned, how long it took, what index, if any, was used as well as a few other pieces of useful information.\nIf we change our query to use an index, we'll see that a BtreeCursor was used, as well as the index used to fulfill the request:\ndb.unicorns.find({name: 'Pilot'}).explain()\nReplication\nMongoDB replication works in some ways similarly to how relational database replication works. All production deployments should be replica sets, which consist of ideally three or more servers that hold the same data.  Writes are sent to a single server, the primary, from where it's asynchronously replicated to every secondary. You can control whether you allow reads to happen on secondaries or not, which can help direct some special queries away from the primary, at the risk of reading slightly stale data. If the primary goes down, one of the secondaries will be automatically elected to be the new primary. Again, MongoDB replication is outside the scope of this book.\nSharding\nMongoDB supports auto-sharding. Sharding is an approach to scalability which partitions your data across multiple servers or clusters. A naive implementation might put all of the data for users with a name that starts with A-M on server 1 and the rest on server 2. Thankfully, MongoDB's sharding capabilities far exceed such a simple algorithm. Sharding is a topic well beyond the scope of this book, but you should know that it exists and that you should consider it, should your needs grow beyond a single replica set.\nWhile replication can help performance somewhat (by isolating long running queries to secondaries, and reducing latency for some other types of queries), its main purpose is to provide high availability. Sharding is the primary method for scaling MongoDB clusters. Combining replication with sharding is the perscribed approach to achieve scaling and high availability.\nStats\nYou can obtain statistics on a database by typing db.stats(). Most of the information deals with the size of your database. You can also get statistics on a collection, say unicorns, by typing db.unicorns.stats(). Most of this information relates to the size of your collection and its indexes.\nProfiler\nYou enable the MongoDB profiler by executing:\ndb.setProfilingLevel(2);\nWith it enabled, we can run a command:\ndb.unicorns.find({weight: {$gt: 600}});\nAnd then examine the profiler:\ndb.system.profile.find()\nThe output tells us what was run and when, how many documents were scanned, and how much data was returned.\nYou disable the profiler by calling setProfilingLevel again but changing the parameter to 0. Specifying 1 as the first parameter will profile queries that take more than 100 milliseconds. 100 milliseconds is the default threshold, you can specify a different minimum time, in milliseconds, with a second parameter:\n//profile anything that takes\n//more than 1 second\ndb.setProfilingLevel(1, 1000);\nBackups and Restore\nWithin the MongoDB bin folder is a mongodump executable. Simply executing mongodump will connect to localhost and backup all of your databases to a dump subfolder. You can type mongodump --help to see additional options. Common options are --db DBNAME to back up a specific database and --collection COLLECTIONNAME to back up a specific collection. You can then use the mongorestore executable, located in the same bin folder, to restore a previously made backup. Again, the --db and --collection can be specified to restore a specific database and/or collection.  mongodump and mongorestore operate on BSON, which is MongoDB's native format.\nFor example, to back up our learn database to a backup folder, we'd execute (this is its own executable which you run in a command/terminal window, not within the mongo shell itself):\nmongodump --db learn --out backup\nTo restore only the unicorns collection, we could then do:\nmongorestore --db learn --collection unicorns \\\n    backup/learn/unicorns.bson\nIt's worth pointing out that mongoexport and mongoimport are two other executables which can be used to export and import data from JSON or CSV. For example, we can get a JSON output by doing:\nmongoexport --db learn --collection unicorns\nAnd a CSV output by doing:\nmongoexport --db learn \\\n    --collection unicorns \\\n    --csv --fields name,weight,vampires\nNote that mongoexport and mongoimport cannot always represent your data. Only mongodump and mongorestore should ever be used for actual backups.  You can read more about your backup options in the MongoDB Manual.\nSummary\nIn this chapter we looked at various commands, tools and performance details of using MongoDB. We haven't touched on everything, but we've looked at some of the common ones. Indexing in MongoDB is similar to indexing with relational databases, as are many of the tools. However, with MongoDB, many of these are to the point and simple to use.\n"},"DB/NoSQL/class.html":{"url":"DB/NoSQL/class.html","title":"MongoDB Excercise from class","keywords":"","body":"Excercise from class\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to display all the documents in the collection series.\n db.series.find()\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to display the fields Title and Season for all the\ndocuments in the collection series.\n db.series.find({}, {Title: 1, Season: 1})\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to display the fields Title, Season and Episode, but\nexclude the field _id for all the documents in the collection series.\n db.series.find({}, {Title: 1, Season: 1, \"Episodes.Episode\": 1, _id : 0})\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to display all the seasons which is in the first series\nyou chose (excluding those from the second series).\n db.series.find({Title: \"Game of Thrones\"})\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to display the first 3 seasons which is in the first\nseries you chose.\n db.series.find({Title : \"Game of Thrones\"}).sort({Season : 1}).limit(3);\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to display the next 2 seasons after skipping first 3\nwhich are in the first series you chose.\n db.series.find({Title : \"Game of Thrones\"}).sort({Season : 1}).skip(3).limit(2);\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to find the Title, Episode and IMDB rating for those\nepisodes which contains 'The' as first three letters for its name.\n db.series.find({\"Episodes.Title\" : { $regex : /^The/ }},{Title : 1, \"Episodes.Title\" : 1, \"Episodes.imdbRating\" : 1, \"Episodes.$\" : 1});\n\n\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to find the Title, Episode and IMDB rating for those\nepisodes which contains 'ing' as last three letters for its name.\n db.series.find({\"Episodes.Title\" : { $regex : /ing$/ }},{Title : 1, \"Episodes.Episode\" : 1, \"Episodes.imdbRating\" : 1});\n\n\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to find the Title, Episode and IMDB rating for those\nepisodes which contains 'car' as three letters somewhere in its name\n\ndb.series.find({\"Episodes.Title\" : { $regex : /rains/i }},{Title : 1, \"Episodes.Episode\" : 1, \"Episodes.imdbRating\" : 1});\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to arrange the name of the series in ascending order\nalong with all the columns.\ndb.series.find({}).sort({Title : 1})\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to arrange the name of the series in ascending order\nwith only the Title column showing.\n\n\ndb.series.find({}, {Title : 1}).sort({Title : 1})\n\nWrite a MongoDB query to arrange the name of the series in descending\nalong with all the columns.\n\n    db.series.find().sort({Title : -1})\n\n\ndb.series.find({ 'Episodes.Title': 'Secrets' }, {'Episodes.$': 1});\n"},"DB/SQL/getting-started.html":{"url":"DB/SQL/getting-started.html","title":"DB/SQL","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nVisual Studio and Microsoft Server management\nInstallation guide\nInstall databases and management studio.\n\nAfter installing the tools above, you need to install Microsoft SQL Express 2014 :\n\n\nDon't forget:\nSqlLocalDB.msi\n\nAnd SQL Server Management Studio 2014 SP1 also:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt238488.aspx\nGithub Repository Databases\n"},"DB/SQL/basic-sql.html":{"url":"DB/SQL/basic-sql.html","title":"Basic T-SQL","keywords":"","body":"Repository\nBasic T-SQL\n3 Levels of interaction\nData Definition Language(DDL)\n\n\nCreate\nAlter\nDrop\nRename\n\nData Manipulation Language (DML)\n\nSelect\nInsert\nUpdate\nDelete\nTruncate\n\nData Control Language(DCL)\n\n\nGrant\nRevoke\n\nCreate\nBasic syntax\nCREATE TABLE \n(\n (),\n (),\n (),\n  \n)\nExample\nCREATE TABLE Student\n(\n stuid INT,\n firstname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,\n lastname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,\n DOB DATE NOT NULL\n);\nAlter\nModifi table structure.\n**Adding New column to table**\nALTER TABLE \nADD  (length)\n\n**Modifying column**\nALTER TABLE \nMODIFY  (lenght)\n\n**Removing column from table**\nALTER TABLE \nDROP COLUMN \nExample\n    Adding New join data column to student table\n    ALTER TABLE Student\n    ADD JoinDate DATE\n**Modifying lastname colument datatype and length**\nALTER TABLE Student\nMODIFY lastname nvarchar(40)\n\n**Removing column from table**\nALTER TABLE Student\nDROP COLUMN firstname\nDrop\nDROP TABLE \nExample\n    DROP TABLE Student\nRename\nRename existing table\nRENAME  to \nExample\nRENAME Student to StudentIndex\nSelect\nBasic query\nSELECT  FROM \nExample:\n    SELECT firstname, lastname FROM Student\nInsert\nInsert\nThis command is used to add new row to the table.\nSyntax:\nINSERT INTO (col1,col2,....coln) VALUES (val1,val2,...valn)\nExample:\nVALUES ('Mike','Jakobsen','6/8/1990\")')\nINSERT INTO Student(firstname,lastname)\nNvarchar\nN' defines the content as Nvarchar.

But in T-SQL we have a facility to execute bunch of statement at a time. Known as Batch Execution. The main use of this is performance. Also if any one statement have syntactical error in any one statement, none of the statement will execute.\nExample\nUSE StudentDb\nINSERT INTO Student(name,email) VALUES ('Mike','mike@jakobsen.dk');\n\nSELECT * FROM Student;\nGO\nIF..ELSE\nDECLARE @temp char(2)\nSELECT @temp = Gender\nFROM Student\nWHERE StudentId=333\nIF @temp='M'\nPRINT 'Hi dude.

Mostly we use these in condition statement where we have more than one statement to execute.\nIF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Student WHERE Gender = 'M') > 0\nBEGIN\nPRINT 'This is a boys college'\nPRINT ' '\nSELECT fname, lname\nFROM Student\nEND\nELSE\nPRINT 'No boys'\nWHILE\nWHILE is used to repeatedly execute statements until the condition became false.

Similarly we use CASE to evaluate an express whether it is true or false based on it uses specific values.\nSELECT latitude , 'For Country' =\nCASE\nWHEN 'AF' THEN 'Afghanistan'\nWHEN 'IN' THEN 'India'\nWHEN 'RU' THEN 'Russia'\nWHEN 'US' THEN 'United States'\nWHEN 'LK' THEN 'Sri Lanka'\nEND\nFROM Country\nTransactions\nTransactions are much like a batch. The only difference between Transaction and batch is we can undo all changes we made by statements with in the single translations. We can not do this in Batch. We use COMMIT TRANSACTION or ROLLBACK TRANSACTION statement at end. If we put ROLLBACK TRANSACTION it will undo all the changes.\nBEGIN TRANSACTION\nSELECT * FROM Student\n......\nCOMMIT TRANSACTION\nTo undo a transaction.\nROLLBACK TRANSACTION;\nStored Procedures\nEmpiri\nStored Procedures are most Important concept in databases. There are many advantages using stored procedures. Mainly performance because sorted procedures are compiled and will be cashed after first time we used it. Another big advantage is we can call stored procedures form programming languages like c#.\nAs with views, stored procedures can be used to return a result set based on a SELECT statement.\nCREATE PROCEDURE Mike\n @sname nvarchar(50)\nAS\nSELECT fname,lname,rolno\n  FROM Student\nWHERE fname = @sname\nGROUP BY fname\nORDER BY fname\nGO\n\n**Exectue stored procedure**\nEXECUTE usp 'Mike'\nGO\n"},"DB/SQL/sql-notes.html":{"url":"DB/SQL/sql-notes.html","title":"T-SQL Notes","keywords":"","body":"Repository\nT-SQL\nNotes\n-- To add comments in T-SQL\nRight-click table and select Design.

Instead of using var, which provides function scope, it is recommended to use let in ES6.\nvar a = 2;\n{\n    let a = 3;\n    console.log(a); // 3\n    let a = 5; // TypeError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared\n}\nconsole.log(a); // 2\n\nAnother form of block-scoped declaration is the const, which creates constants. In ES6, a const represents a constant reference to a value. In other words, the value is not frozen, just the assignment of it. Here's a simple example:\n{\n    const B = 5;\n    B = 10; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable\n\n    const ARR = [5, 6];\n    ARR.push(7);\n    console.log(ARR); // [5,6,7]\n    ARR = 10; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable\n    ARR[0] = 3; // value is mutable\n    console.log(ARR); // [3,6,7]\n}\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\nHoisting of let and const vary from the traditional hoisting of variables and functions. Both let and const are hoisted, but cannot be accessed before their declaration, because of Temporal Dead Zone \nlet and const are scoped to the nearest enclosing block.\nWhen using const, use CAPITAL_CASING (this is a common convention).\nconst has to be defined with its declaration.\n\nArrow Functions\nArrow functions are a short-hand notation for writing functions in ES6. The arrow function definition consists of a parameter list ( ... ), followed by the => marker and a function body.\nUnlike functions, arrows share the same lexical this as their surrounding code.\n// Classical Function Expression\nlet addition = function(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n};\n\n// Implementation with arrow function\nlet addition = (a, b) => a + b;\n\nNote that in the above example, the addition arrow function is implemented with \"concise body\" which does not need an explicit return statement.\nHere is an example with the usual \"block body\"\nThe map function is being called on the arr array - return each fruit, then appening an s to the end.\nlet arr = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];\n\nlet breakfast = arr.map(fruit => {\n    return fruit + 's';\n});\n\nconsole.log(breakfast); // ['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges']\n\nBehold! There is more...\nArrow functions don't just make the code shorter. They are closely related to this binding behavior.\nArrow functions behavior with this keyword varies from that of normal functions. Each function in JavaScript defines its own this context but arrow functions capture the this value of the nearest enclosing context. Check out the following code:\nfunction Person() {\n    // The Person() constructor defines `this` as an instance of itself.\n    this.age = 0;\n\n    setInterval(function growUp() {\n        // In non-strict mode, the growUp() function defines `this`\n        // as the global object, which is different from the `this`\n        // defined by the Person() constructor.\n        this.age++;\n    }, 1000);\n}\nvar p = new Person();\n\nIn ECMAScript 3/5, this issue was fixed by assigning the value in this to a variable that could be closed over.\nfunction Person() {\n    var self = this;\n    self.age = 0;\n\n    setInterval(function growUp() {\n        // The callback refers to the `self` variable of which\n        // the value is the expected object.\n        self.age++;\n    }, 1000);\n}\n\nAs mentioned above, arrow functions capture the this value of the nearest enclosing context, so the following code works as expected, even with nested arrow functions.\nfunction Person() {\n    this.age = 0;\n\n    setInterval(() => {\n        setTimeout(() => {\n            this.age++; // `this` properly refers to the person object\n        }, 1000);\n    }, 1000);\n}\n\nvar p = new Person();\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#Lexical_this\nThe Arrow function specification draft\nhttp://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:arrow_function_syntax\nDefault Function Parameters\nES6 allows you to set default parameters in function definitions. Here is a simple illustration.\nInput => Output\nlet getFinalPrice = (price, tax = 0.7) => price + price * tax;\ngetFinalPrice(500); // 850\n\nSpread / Rest Operator\n... operator is referred to as spread or rest operator, depending on how and where it is used.\nWhen used with any iterable, it acts as to \"spread\" it into individual elements:\nfunction foo(x, y, z) {\n    console.log(x, y, z);\n}\n\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3];\nfoo(...arr); // 1 2 3\n\nThe other common usage of ... is gathering a set of values together into an array. This is referred as \"rest\" operator.\nfunction foo(...args) {\n    console.log(args);\n}\nfoo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nObject Literal Extensions\nES6 allows declaring object literals by providing shorthand syntax for initializing properties from variables and defining function methods. It also enables the ability to have computed property keys in an object literal definition.\nfunction getCar(make, model, value) {\n    return {\n        // with property value shorthand\n        // syntax, you can omit the property\n        // value if key matches variable\n        // name\n        make,  // same as make: make\n        model, // same as model: model\n        value, // same as value: value\n\n        // computed values now work with\n        // object literals\n        ['make' + make]: true,\n\n        // Method definition shorthand syntax\n        // omits `function` keyword & colon\n        depreciate() {\n            this.value -= 2500;\n        }\n    };\n}\n\nlet car = getCar('Kia', 'Sorento', 40000);\nconsole.log(car);\n// {\n//     make: 'Kia',\n//     model:'Sorento',\n//     value: 40000,\n//     makeKia: true,\n//     depreciate: function()\n// }\n\nThe depreciate function is then called with. car.depreciate();\nArray and Object Destructuring\nDestructuring helps in avoiding the need for temp variables when dealing with object and arrays.\nfunction foo() {\n    return [1, 2, 3];\n}\nlet arr = foo(); // [1,2,3]\n\nlet [a, b, c] = foo();\nconsole.log(a, b, c); // 1 2 3\n\nfunction bar() {\n    return {\n        x: 4,\n        y: 5,\n        z: 6\n    };\n}\nlet { x: a, y: b, z: c } = bar();\nconsole.log(a, b, c); // 4 5 6\n\n8. super in Objects\nES6 allows to use super method in (classless) objects with prototypes. Following is a simple example:\nvar parent = {\n    foo() {\n        console.log(\"Hello from the Parent\");\n    }\n}\n\nvar child = {\n    foo() {\n        super.foo();\n        console.log(\"Hello from the Child\");\n    }\n}\n\nObject.setPrototypeOf(child, parent);\nchild.foo(); // Hello from the Parent\n             // Hello from the Child\n\n9. Template Literal and Delimiters\nES6 introduces an easier way to add interpolations which are evaluated automatically.\n\n`${ ... }` is used for rendering the variables.\n` Backtick is used as delimiter.\n\nlet user = 'Kevin';\nconsole.log(`Hi ${user}!`); // Hi Kevin!\n\n10. for...of vs for...in\n\nfor...of iterates over iterable objects, such as array.\n\nlet nicknames = ['di', 'boo', 'punkeye'];\nnicknames.size = 3;\nfor (let nickname of nicknames) {\n    console.log(nickname);\n}\n// di\n// boo\n// punkeye\n\n\nfor...in iterates over all enumerable properties of an object.\n\nlet nicknames = ['di', 'boo', 'punkeye'];\nnicknames.size = 3;\nfor (let nickname in nicknames) {\n    console.log(nickname);\n}\n// 0\n// 1\n// 2\n// size\n\n11. Map and WeakMap\nES6 introduces new set of data structures called Map and WeakMap. Now, we actually use maps in JavaScript all the time. In fact every object can be considered as a Map.\nAn object is made of keys (always strings) and values, whereas in Map, any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value. Have a look at this piece of code:\nvar myMap = new Map();\n\nvar keyString = \"a string\",\n    keyObj = {},\n    keyFunc = function() {};\n\n// setting the values\nmyMap.set(keyString, \"value associated with 'a string'\");\nmyMap.set(keyObj, \"value associated with keyObj\");\nmyMap.set(keyFunc, \"value associated with keyFunc\");\n\nmyMap.size; // 3\n\n// getting the values\nmyMap.get(keyString);    // \"value associated with 'a string'\"\nmyMap.get(keyObj);       // \"value associated with keyObj\"\nmyMap.get(keyFunc);      // \"value associated with keyFunc\"\n\nWeakMap\nA WeakMap is a Map in which the keys are weakly referenced, that doesn’t prevent its keys from being garbage-collected. That means you don't have to worry about memory leaks.\nAnother thing to note here- in WeakMap as opposed to Map every key must be an object.\nA WeakMap only has four methods delete(key), has(key), get(key) and set(key, value).\nlet w = new WeakMap();\nw.set('a', 'b');\n// Uncaught TypeError: Invalid value used as weak map key\n\nvar o1 = {},\n    o2 = function(){},\n    o3 = window;\n\nw.set(o1, 37);\nw.set(o2, \"azerty\");\nw.set(o3, undefined);\n\nw.get(o3); // undefined, because that is the set value\n\nw.has(o1); // true\nw.delete(o1);\nw.has(o1); // false\n\n12. Set and WeakSet\nSet objects are collections of unique values. Duplicate values are ignored, as the collection must have all unique values. The values can be primitive types or object references.\nlet mySet = new Set([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]);\nmySet.size; // 3\nmySet.has(1); // true\nmySet.add('strings');\nmySet.add({ a: 1, b:2 });\n\nYou can iterate over a set by insertion order using either the forEach method or the for...of loop.\nmySet.forEach((item) => {\n    console.log(item);\n    // 1\n    // 2\n    // 3\n    // 'strings'\n    // Object { a: 1, b: 2 }\n});\n\nfor (let value of mySet) {\n    console.log(value);\n    // 1\n    // 2\n    // 3\n    // 'strings'\n    // Object { a: 1, b: 2 }\n}\n\nSets also have the delete() and clear() methods.\nWeakSet\nSimilar to WeakMap, the WeakSet object lets you store weakly held objects in a collection. An object in the WeakSet occurs only once; it is unique in the WeakSet's collection.\nvar ws = new WeakSet();\nvar obj = {};\nvar foo = {};\n\nws.add(window);\nws.add(obj);\n\nws.has(window); // true\nws.has(foo);    // false, foo has not been added to the set\n\nws.delete(window); // removes window from the set\nws.has(window);    // false, window has been removed\n\nClasses in ES6\nES6 introduces new class syntax. One thing to note here is that ES6 class is not a new object-oriented inheritance model. They just serve as a syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.\nOne way to look at a class in ES6 is just a new syntax to work with prototypes and contructor functions that we'd use in ES5.\nFunctions defined using the static keyword implement static/class functions on the class.\nclass Task {\n    constructor() {\n        console.log(\"task instantiated!\");\n    }\n\n    showId() {\n        console.log(23);\n    }\n\n    static loadAll() {\n        console.log(\"Loading all tasks..\");\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(typeof Task); // function\nlet task = new Task(); // \"task instantiated!\"\ntask.showId(); // 23\nTask.loadAll(); // \"Loading all tasks..\"\n\nextends and super in classes\nConsider the following code:\nclass Car {\n    constructor() {\n        console.log(\"Creating a new car\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Porsche extends Car {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        console.log(\"Creating Porsche\");\n    }\n}\n\nlet c = new Porsche();\n// Creating a new car\n// Creating Porsche\n\nextends allow child class to inherit from parent class in ES6. It is important to note that the derived constructor must call super().\nAlso, you can call parent class's method in child class's methods using super.parentMethodName()\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\nClass declarations are not hoisted. You first need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise ReferenceError will be thrown.\nThere is no need to use function keyword when defining functions inside a class definition.\n\n14. Symbol\nA Symbol is a unique and immutable data type introduced in ES6. The purpose of a symbol is to generate a unique identifier but you can never get any access to that identifier.\nHere’s how you create a symbol:\nvar sym = Symbol(\"some optional description\");\nconsole.log(typeof sym); // symbol\n\nNote that you cannot use new with Symbol(…).\nIf a symbol is used as a property/key of an object, it’s stored in a special way that the property will not show up in a normal enumeration of the object’s properties.\nvar o = {\n    val: 10,\n    [Symbol(\"random\")]: \"I'm a symbol\",\n};\n\nconsole.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(o)); // val\n\nTo retrieve an object’s symbol properties, use Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(o)\nIterators\nAn iterator accesses the items from a collection one at a time, while keeping track of its current position within that sequence. It provides a next() method which returns the next item in the sequence. This method returns an object with two properties: done and value.\nES6 has Symbol.iterator which specifies the default iterator for an object. Whenever an object needs to be iterated (such as at the beginning of a for..of loop), its @@iterator method is called with no arguments, and the returned iterator is used to obtain the values to be iterated.\nLet’s look at an array, which is an iterable, and the iterator it can produce to consume its values:\nvar arr = [11,12,13];\nvar itr = arr[Symbol.iterator]();\n\nitr.next(); // { value: 11, done: false }\nitr.next(); // { value: 12, done: false }\nitr.next(); // { value: 13, done: false }\n\nitr.next(); // { value: undefined, done: true }\n\nNote that you can write custom iterators by defining obj[Symbol.iterator]() with the object definition.\n16. Generators\nGenerator functions are a new feature in ES6 that allow a function to generate many values over time by returning an object which can be iterated over to pull values from the function one value at a time.\nA generator function returns an iterable object when it's called.\nIt is written using the new * syntax as well as the new yield keyword introduced in ES6.\nfunction *infiniteNumbers() {\n    var n = 1;\n    while (true) {\n        yield n++;\n    }\n}\n\nvar numbers = infiniteNumbers(); // returns an iterable object\n\nnumbers.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }\nnumbers.next(); // { value: 2, done: false }\nnumbers.next(); // { value: 3, done: false }\n\nEach time yield is called, the yielded value becomes the next value in the sequence.\nAlso, note that generators compute their yielded values on demand, which allows them to efficiently represent sequences that are expensive to compute, or even infinite sequences.\n17. Promises\nES6 has native support for promises. A promise is an object that is waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete, and when that operation completes, the promise is either fulfilled(resolved) or rejected.\nThe standard way to create a Promise is by using the new Promise() constructor which accepts a handler that is given two functions as parameters. The first handler (typically named resolve) is a function to call with the future value when it's ready; and the second handler (typically named reject) is a function to call to reject the Promise if it can't resolve the future value.\nvar p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {  \n    if (/* condition */) {\n        resolve(/* value */);  // fulfilled successfully\n    } else {\n        reject(/* reason */);  // error, rejected\n    }\n});\n\nEvery Promise has a method named then which takes a pair of callbacks. The first callback is called if the promise is resolved, while the second is called if the promise is rejected.\np.then((val) => console.log(\"Promise Resolved\", val),\n       (err) => console.log(\"Promise Rejected\", err));\n\nReturning a value from then callbacks will pass the value to the next then callback.\nvar hello = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {  \n    resolve(\"Hello\");\n});\n\nhello.then((str) => `${str} World`)\n     .then((str) => `${str}!`)\n     .then((str) => console.log(str)) // Hello World!\n\nWhen returning a promise, the resolved value of the promise will get passed to the next callback to effectively chain them together.\nThis is a simple technique to avoid \"callback hell\".\nvar p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {  \n    resolve(1);\n});\n\nvar eventuallyAdd1 = (val) => {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n        resolve(val + 1);\n    });\n}\n\np.then(eventuallyAdd1)\n .then(eventuallyAdd1)\n .then((val) => console.log(val)) // 3\n\n"},"js/good-parts.html":{"url":"js/good-parts.html","title":"Good Parts","keywords":"","body":"Good Parts\nJavascript: The Good Parts Slideshow\n\nMost programming languages contain good parts and bad parts.

//workaround\n\n    var innerFunc = function() {\n        globalScopeThis.value = add(globalScopeThis.value, globalScopeThis.value);\n    };\n\n    innerFunc(); //invoke innerFunc as function\n};\n\nmyObject.double();\nconsole.log(myObject.value);\n\nConstructor Invocation Pattern\n\nWhen a function is created with new, that function contains a link to the function's prototype\nThis means that methods that were created for the prototype function are also available to the function created using new\n\n//create a function Quo that takes a string - Quo will be our prototype function as we will see\nvar Quo = function (string){\n    this.status = string;\n}\n\n//Now create a get_status method for Quo - this will be a public method\nQuo.prototype.get_status = function {\n    return this.status;\n}\n\n//create a new instance of Quo using the prefix NEW\nvar myQuo = new Quo(\"happy\");\n\n//because of the use of the new prefix, myQuo is an instance of Quo which means it can access the public method get_status from it's prototype\ndocument.writeIn(myQuo.get_status());     //returns 'happy'\n\n\nThis style of constructor pattern is not recommended, there will be better examples in Chapter 5 - this is noted again in Appendix B\nThe first letter of a constructor function (in this case Quo) must always be capitalized\n\nApply Invocation Pattern\n\nThe apply method lets you choose the value to be bound to this\nIt also takes the parameters for a function in an array\nFormat:   function.apply(valueForThis, arrayOfParamentersForFunction);\n\nvar array = [5, 2]    //will be the parameters for our function\nvar sum = add.apply(null, array);     //value of 'this' is null and value of sum is 7 as the 'apply' method passes 5 and 2 to the 'add' method\n\nArguments\n\nAnother default parameter of functions is the arguments array which contains all the arguments that were supplied when the function was invoked\nThis means you don't have to know the exact number of arguments when you build a function because you can loop through all the arguments provided at invocation with the use of the default arguments array//inside the function\nfor (i = 0; i \n\narguments lacks all the array methods except .length because of a bug\n\nReturn\n\nWhen a function gets to a return statement, it returns immediately without carrying out the remaining statements in the function\nA function always returns a value or if unspecified, it returns undefined\n\"If the function was invoked with the new prefix (used when creating a new object so it must return an object) and the return value is not an object, then this (the new object) is returned instead.\"\n\nExceptions\n\nA throw statement interrupts the execution of the code is used to handle expected exceptions like an incorrect type of argument (e.g. a string where a number is expected)\nEach throw statement should have an exception object with a name holding the type of exception and a message with an explanation of it + any other properties you like//Thinking through what exceptions could happen in an add function, the main function contains the throw statement with the exception object\nvar add = function (a,b) {\n  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number'){\n      throw {\n          name: 'TypeError';\n          message: 'The add function requires numbers';\n      }\n  }\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n\nWhen you write a function to use add(), you include a try block where the exception object from the throw statement in add() will pass control to a single catch clause for all exceptions\n\n//When you use the function later on, add a try block with a catch clause to catch the exception object\nvar try_it = function () {\n    try{\n        add(\"seven\");   //will throw an exception as it is not a number\n    }\n    catch (e) {\n        document.writeIn(e.name + ':' + e.message);\n    }\n}\n\ntry_it();    //you could rewrite this function so the argument is passed in here where it is invoked\n\nAugmenting Types\n\nAdding a method to the prototype of an object Object.prototype (or function, array, string, number, regular expression or boolean), you make it available to all the instances of that object so you don't have to use the prototype property again\nBy augmenting the basic types (essentially the root prototypes), we can improve Javascript overall\nFor example, adding a method named trim to remove spaces from the end of strings, available to all String instances in your code:String.method ('trim', function {\n  return this.replace(/ˆ\\s+|\\s+$/g, '');     //uses regular expression\n});\n\n\nTo be on the safe side, create a method conditionally, only when you know the method is missing\n\n//Makes a method available to all functions, ONLY when it definitely does not already exist\n\nFunction.prototype.method (methodName, func) {\n    if (!this.prototype[methodName]){\n        this.prototype[methodName] = func;\n        return this;\n    }\n};\n\n\nRemember that for in statements don't work well with prototypes\n\nRecursion\n\nUsed when a task can be divided into simple sub-problems and a function can call itself repeatedly to solve them\nTakes the format:\n\nvar variable = function functionName (parameters){\n    //wrap the statements to be executed and the recursive call in a loop statement so ir doesn't recurse forever\n    //statements to be executed in the function;\n    functionName(arguments);\n};\n\nfunctionName (initialArguments); //initial call to the funtion\n\n\nJavascript does not have tail recursion optimization and therefore does optimize recursive functions - this also means they sometimes fail if they \"recurse very deeply\"\n\nScope\n\nA block is a set of statements contained in curly brackets {}\nJavacript does not have block scope but does have function scope\nAll variables declared anywhere within a function are available everywhere in that function - i.e. and inner function will have access to the variables of the outer function in which it is defined\nA variable can be overwritten with a new value in an inner function and that new value's scope will be just the body of the inner function - as soon as you're back out to the outer function, the value of that variable will revert to what it was before the inner function began its execution\nAll variable should be declared at the top of the function body\n\n\n\nClosure\n\nInner functions have access to the actual parameters of the outer functions (not copies)\nIf an object is created as a result of a function and assigned to myObject, myObject continues to share access to the variables in the functions that created it (actual variables, not copies)\nIt has access to the context in which it was created - this is closure\nThis includes later on, even if the outer function has completed its execution and returned, when the inner function is called, it will still have access to all the variables it had access to at the time it was defined (i.e. the variables that were in context when the inner function was defined)\n\n\n\nCallbacks\n\nA callback function is a function passed to another function as a parameter and executed in this other function\nWhen making a request of a server, use an asynchronous request as asynchronous functions return immediately, therefore freeing up the client\nIn this example, we pass the callback function to the asynchronous request as a parameter so the callback function will only be called when a response is availablerequest = prepare_the_request();\nsend_request_asynchronously(request, function(response){     //function being passed in as a parameter\ndisplay(response);\n});\n\n\n\n\n\nModule\n\nA module is a function or object whose contents can be used, but its state and implementation are hidden\nIt is essentially using function scope and closures keep the variables and functions contained within as private as well as binding them to a non-global object - whilst still being accessible\nUsing the module pattern is widely used and good practice as it promotes information hiding (avoiding naming conflicts, etc) and encapsulation\nThis is a good article on how to use the module pattern with examples\n\n\nIt can also be used to produce secure objects (see durable objects below)\n\nMethods contained in the object do not make use of this or that so it becomes impossible to change them from outside of the object except in ways explicitly permitted by the methods (like passing them a parameter)\nThe methods can be replaced but the secrets of how these methods function (like how they generate a number for example) can't be revealed because they are not tied to a global object\nvar Serial_maker = function() {\n\n//all variables defined in this object are now fixed and hidden from anything outside this function\n//see page 42 of book for full example\n};\n//calls to methods passing them parameters are made here\n\n\n\n\nNote: While Javascript variables are usually lowercase, there is some convention around capitalizing the first letter of a Module\n\nCascade\n\nSome methods return nothing, albeit undefined\nIf we alter these methods to return this instead of undefined, they return the object which can then be passed to the next method, e.g getElement(myBox).move(350,150) gets the element and then passes is to the move function for the next action\nThis enables cascades, where you call many methods on the same object in sequence because the object is passed from one method to the next (usually separated by . as above)\n\n\nCascades also stop you from trying to do too much in one method and makes your code more descriptive\n\nCurry\n\nA curry method allows you to partially evaluate an existing function\nAn example is below where the function expects two arguments, but it is first invoked with only one  (in this case using curry as in add.curry(10);) and then later passed the second argument\n\n\nIt can also be explained as transforming a function that takes multiple arguments (add(a,b)) into a chain of functions that take a single argument each (addA = add(A); addA(B); where the two functions are now add() & addA())\n\n//set up a simple function that we will customise with curry\nvar add = function (a,b){\n    return a + b;\n}\n\nvar addTen = add.curry(10);      //passes 10 as the first argument to the add() function\naddTen(20);                     //The use of the curry method in addTen means addTen === add(10, 20);\n\n\nJavascript does not have a curry method natively but this can be added to the Function.protoype:Function.method('curry', function() {\n  var slice = Array.prototype.slice,\n      args = slice.apply(arguments),\n      that = this;\n  return function () {\n      return that.apply(null, args.concat(slice.apply(arguments)));\n  }\n});\n\n\n\nMemoization\n\nStoring the results of previous operations in objects (such as arrays) allows them to be reused without having to keep recalculating the value - this optimization is called memoization\nAdding an object to store the results memoizes the function\n\n\nParticularly useful when a function is recursive and uses the results of its previous iteration in the current iteration\nA memoizer function can be created to help memoize future functions:var meoizer = function (memo, fundamental) {\n  var shell = function (n) {\n      var result = memo[n];\n      if (typeof result !== 'number') {\n          result = fundamental(shell, n);\n          memo[n] = result;\n      }\n      return result;\n  }\n  return shell;\n}\n\n\n\n"},"js/inheritance.html":{"url":"js/inheritance.html","title":"Inheritance","keywords":"","body":"Inheritance\n\nJavascript is a prototypal language, which means that objects inherit directly from other objects\n\nMain benefit of inheritance is code reuse - you only have to specify differences.\nJavascript can mimic classical inheritance but has a much richer set of code reuse patterns\n\nThis chapter looks at the more straightforward patterns but it is always best to keep it simple\n\nPseudoclassical\n\nThe pseudoclassical code reuse pattern essentially has constructor functions (functions invoked using the new prefix) work like classes to mimic the classical structure\n\nAll properties are public\nIf you forget to use the new prefix, this is not bound to the new object - it is instead bound to the global object and you'll be unwittingly altering these instead!\n\n\nThere is no need to use it, there are better code reuse patterns in JavaScript\n\n\nObject Specifiers\nRather than: var myObject = maker (f, l, m, c, s) which has too many parameters to remember in the right order, use an object specifier:\nvar myObject = maker ({      //note curly braces\n    first: f,\n    last: l,\n    state: s,\n    city: c\n    }\n;)\n\nto contain them.

It was supposed to be a word-boundary anchor but is useless for multilingual applications\nRegexp Group\nFour kinds of groups:\n Capturing: (...) where each group is captured into the result array - the first capturing group in the regexp goes into result[1], the second into result[2] and so on\n Noncapturing (?:...) where the text is matched, but not captured and saved anywhere, making is slightly faster than a capturing group (has no bearing on numbering of capturing groups)\n\nPositive lookahead, a bad part: (?=...) acts like a noncapturing group except after the match is made, it goes back to where text started\nNegative lookahead, a bad part: (?!...) is like a positive lookahead but only matches if there is no match with what is in it\n\nRegexp Class\n\nConveniently and easily specifies one of a set of characters using square brackets [], for example vowels: [aeiou]\nCan shorten specification of all 32 ASCII special characters to [!-\\/:-@[-'{-˜] (note that the ' in this piece of code should be a back-tick which I can't use as part of these notes)\nAlso allows ˆ as the first character after the opening [ to mean NOT the characters in the character set\n\nRegexp Class Escape\nThere are specific characters that must be escaped in a character class: -  /  [  \\  ]  ˆ\nRegexp Quantifier\nA quantifier at the en of a factor indicates how many times the factor should be matched\n\nA number in curly braces means the factor should match that many times, so /o{3} matches ooo\nTwo comma-seperated numbers in curly braces provide the range of times a factor should match, so {3,5} indicates it will match 3, 4 or 5 times\nZero or one times (same thing as saying something is optional) can be ? or {0,1}\nZero or more times can be * or {0,}\nOne or more times can be + or {1,}\n\nPrefer to use 'zero or more' or 'one or more' matching over the 'zero or one' matching - i.e. prefer greedy matching over lazy matching\n"},"js/methods.html":{"url":"js/methods.html","title":"Methods","keywords":"","body":"Methods\nArrays\narray.concat(item...)\nProduces new array copying the original array with the items appended to it (does not modify the original array like array.push(item) does.

If position is not provided, search starts at the beginning of the string.\nReturns the integer position of the first matched character or -1 if no match is found.\nstring.lastIndexOf(searchString, position)\nSame as indexOf but searches from the end of the string instead of the beginning.\nstring.localeCompare(that)\nCompares string to that parameter and returns:\n\n0 if string === that\n-1 if string that\n\nNB. 'a' \nstring.match(regexp)\nWorks the same way as regexp.exec(string) if there is no g flag in the regexp.\nIf there is a g flag in teh regexp, it produces an array of the matches but excludes the capturing groups\nstring.replace(searchValue, replaceValue)\nSearches for the searchValue in string and replaces it with the replaceValue.\nIf searchValue is a:\n\nstring, only its first occurrence will be replaced with the replaceValue\nregexp with a g flag, all occurrences will be replaced with the replaceValue; otherwise, only the first occurrence will be replaced\n\nIf replaceValue is a:\n\nstring, a $ value has a special meaning when used in the replaceValue that conveys what to replace - see table on page 90 for possible variations on $\nfunction, it is called for each match and the string result of the function is used as the replacement text\nstring result of the first call will replace capture group 1 of the string and so on\n\n\n\nstring.search(regexp)\nSimilar to .indexOf(string) but takes a regexp instead of a string, returning the position of the first match (or -1 if there is no match).\nThe g flag is ignored.\nstring.slice(start, end)\nCreates a new string by copying the characters from the start position to the character before the end position in string.\nThe end parameter is optiona and defaults to string.length. If either parameter is negative, string.length is added to it.\nstring.split(separator, limit)\nCreates an array of strings by splitting apart string at the points where the separator appears (e.g. if the separator is '.', ab.cd' becomes ['ab', 'cd']).\n\nIf separator is an empty string, an array of single characters is produced.\nlimit is optional and determines how many pieces are to be split off from the original string.\nThe separator can be a regexp but\ntext from capturing groups within the regexp will be included in the split - e.g. in var e = text.split(/\\s*(,)\\s*/); the commas (,) will each be included as a separate element in the resulting array\nsome systems ignore empty strings when the separator is a regexp\n\n\n\nstring.substring(start, end)\nNo reason to use, use slice instead.\nstring.toLocaleLowerCase()\nProduces a new string converted to lower case, using the rules for the particular locale (geography).\nstring.toLocaleUpperCase()\nProduces a new string converted to upper case, using the rules for the particular locale (geography).\nstring.toLowerCase()\nProduces a new string converted to lower case.\nstring.toUpperCase()\nProduces a new string converted to upper case.\nString.fromCharCode(char...)\nProduces a new string from a series of numbers.\nvar a = String.fromCharCode(67, 97, 116);    //a === 'Cat'\nNB.

They can be changed at any time by any part of the program which makes them unreliable in larger complex programs. This can also lead to naming conflicts which can cause your code to fail or you to accidentally overwrite a global variable.\nDefined in three ways:\n\nUsing a var statement outside of any function; var foo = value;\nBy adding a property to the global object (container of all global variables), such as window in browsers; window.foo = value;\nUsing a variable without declaring it with var, which makes it an implied global; foo = value\n\nScope\nAlthough JavaScript has block syntax (i.e. is written in blocks) like a lot of other programming languages, it has functional scope and not block scope.\nVariables should all be declared at the top of the function and not littered throughout the block.\nSemicolon Insertion\nAttempts to correct faulty programs by automatically inserting semicolons. Do not depend on this as it can hide underlying issues.\nAlso ensure opening curly braces ({) are on the first line of a statement, otherwise semicolons will be erroneously inserted and cause problems:\n//Ensure curly braces open on the first line of a statement\nreturn {\n    status: true    //for example\n};\n//instead of\nreturn\n{\n    status:true\n};\n\nReserved Words\nMost JavaScript reserved words are not used in the language but cannot be used to name variables or parameters.\nIf used as the key in object literals, they must be quoted. For example object - {'case' : value}; or object['final'] = value; as case and final are both reserved words.\nUnicode\nJavaScript characters are 16 bits which only cover the original Unicode Basic Multilingual Place.\ntypeof\nWatch out for:\n\ntypeof null which returns 'object' instead of 'null'\nincorrect reporting on typeof regular expressions, with some implementations returning 'object' and some returning 'function'\narrays are objects in JavaScript so typeof array will return 'object'\n\nAll objects are truthy and null is falsy, so you can use the following to tell them apart:\nif (my_value && typeof my_value === 'object') {\n    //then my value is definitely an object or an array because not only is its 'typeof' an object but it's also truthy (first statement)\n}\n\nNaN\n\ntypeof NaN === 'number' even though it stands for not-a-number\nIf you have a chain of formulas that together produce a NaN then at least one of them will have generated NaN\nSurprisingly NaN !=== NaN\nisNaN(value) can be used to distinguish numbers from NaN\n\nFor numbers, best use your own isNumber formula:\nvar isNumber = function isNumber(value) {\n    return typeof value === 'number' && isFinite(value);    //isFinite() rejects NaN and Infinity, but is only good for numbers, not strings\n}\n\nPhony Arrays\nJavaScript doesn't have real arrays, it has array-like objects.\n\nGood: No need to give them dimensions and don't generate out-of-bounds errors\nBad: Slower than 'real' arrays\n\nTo test if value is an array:\nif (my_value && typeof my_value === 'object' && typeof my_value.length === 'number' &&\n    !(my_value.propertyIsEnumerable('length'))) {\n        //my_value is definitelyy an array!\n}\n\nThe arguments array isn't an array, just an object with a length property.\nFalsy Values\n0, NaN, '', false, null and undefined are all falsy values, but they are not interchangeable. When testing for a missing member of an object for example, you need to use undefined and not null.\nundefined and NaN are actually global variables instead of constants but don't change their values.\nObject\nJavaScript objects inherit members from the prototype chain so they are never truly empty.\nTo test for membership without prototype chain involvement, use the hasOwnProperty method or limit your results (for example, to specific types like number so you know you're not dragging in object members from up the prototype for example if that's what's causing the problem).\n"},"js/the_bad_parts.html":{"url":"js/the_bad_parts.html","title":"The Bad parts","keywords":"","body":"The Bad Parts\nAvoid these altogether\n\n== and !=: Don't function properly when result is false, use === or !== instead\nwith statement: Intended to provide a shortcut to properties of an object but results vary every time it is run\neval: Adds unnecessary complication and compromises the security of the application\nGiving string arguments to setTimeout and setInterval should also be avoided as this makes them act like eval\n\n\ncontinue statement: Forces a loop into its next iteration but the code is usually much improved when re-written without continue\nswitch fall through: In a switch statement, each case falls through to the next case unless you explicityly disrup the flow, but using these intentional fall throughs makes the unintentional ones that are causing errors basically impossible to find\nThis is one of those parts of JavaScript that appears useful but you're better off avoiding because it's occasionally very dangerous\n\n\nBlock-less statements: Always use curly braces {} to block in statements so as to avoid misinterpretation and aid error finding\nBitwise operators: Shouldn't really be doing this kind of manipulations because they are quite slow in JavaScript, therefore there shouldn't be a need to use &, |, ˆ, ˜, >>, >>> or \nThis doesn't mean you can't use && for example\n\n\n++ and --: This one seems debatable to me; Douglas Crockford finds it makes his coding style much more cryptic and difficult to read (the book uses +=1 and -=1 instead)\n\nThe function statement vs the function expression:\nTo use JavaScript well, important to understand that functions are values.\n\nA function statement is shorthand for a var statement with a function value, so function foo() {} (a function statement) means pretty much the same as var foo = function foo(){}; (a function expression)\nLogically, to write the language well you should define a function before using it, but in JavaScript, function statements (using just function foo(){}) are hoisted to the top of the scope in which they are defined - this encourages sloppy programming and should be avoided\nfunction statements also don't function consistently in if statements\nif you need to start a function expression with the word function, wrap it in parentheses (), or JavaScript assumes it's a function statement\n\nTyped wrappers:\nDon't use new Boolean or new String or new Number, it's completely unnecessary.

De enkelte aspekter af modulet, som senere er benyttet, skal derfor eksporteres.\nEt eksempel funktionaliteren tilknyttet de enkelte chat rum. For at skabe disse funktionalitet benyttes modulerne.Mongoose og Logger/Winston, men da disse moduler ikke benyttes direkte i disse funktioner, men blot variabler og funktionalitet udledt af disse moduler. Eksporteres roomModel og userModel der er udledt af Mongoose funktionaliter. Dermed holdes modulerne som helhed ude af det globale namespace.

Tilgåer brugeren en fejlmeddelelse via Connect-flash middlewaren. Hvis conditional statementen derimod evalueres til false, tjekkes brugerens indtastninger op imod databasens Users collection.\nFindes brugeren, tilgår den besøgende igen en fejlmeddelelse.

Der i tilfældet at det indtastede password matcher, det i databasen. Videregiver callbacket isMatch.

Indledningsvis importeres Moment.js i node-serveren.\nvar moment = require('moment');\nmoment().format();\n\nMoment.js laver en wrapper omkring Date object. For at tilgå denne wrapper kaldes moment() med en dato som parameter.\nFor at ændre tidsangivelserne i beskederne, kaldes moment(message.date) derfor, samt fromNow(). Som en del af en EJS template string, ser det således ud.\n\n\nEjS og Moment.js\nMongoose\nMongoose er en (ODM) object data modeling, der gør det muligt at fastsætte en datamodel, og dermed en struktur i den gemte data.\nKontra en ORM som fx. Laravel Elequent. Der mapper SQL-syntaxen så PHP kan interagere med SQL. Behøver en ODM som Mongoose ikke redefinere forholdet imellem database og applicationen, da JSON og BSON interager gnindningsfrit.\nEJS\nEJS benyttes som template engine. En template engine gør det muligt at benytte statiske filer som html, da template enginen tilføjer eventuel dynamisk indhold ved runtime, og sender disse til clienten. Express understøtter en række template engines. For at bibeholde den grundlæggende html struktur benyttes EJS, der som navnet antyder Èmbedded JavaScript, tillader fx at frekventere et ForLoop, der tillader applicationen  at iterere over de gemte beskeder for dernæst at printe de sendte beskeder.\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nI forhold til de runtime sendte beskeder fra Socket.io, printes disse via JavaScript. Da EJS ikke tillader at tilføje elementer til applications DOM løbende. Disse beskeder appendes dernæst til .chat history ul. Med hjælp fra Jquery.\naddMessage: function(message, users){\n    message.date      = (new Date(message.date)).toLocaleString();\n    message.username  = this.encodeHTML(message.username);\n    message.content   = this.encodeHTML(message.content);\n\n\n    var html = `\n        \n        ${message.date} &nbsp; &nbsp;\n    ${message.username}\n        \n        \n        ${message.content}\n    \n        `;\n}\n\n$(html).hide().appendTo('.chat-history ul').slideDown(200);\n\n}\n\nGulp\nhttps://github.com/mikejakobsen/meanchat/blob/Date-fix/gulpfile.js\nGulp er en Javascript task runner, der gør det muligt at automatisere visse monotome opgaver, under udviklingen.\nGulp benyttes bland andet til at kompilere SASS til CSS. Samt at køre BrowserSync under udviklingen, der automatisk refresher browseren, så ændrningerne vises løbende.\n\n\n\nGulp task\nFunktion\n\n\n\n\nImages\nKomprimerer og eksporterer billeder\n\n\nStyles\nCompiler SASS, Autoprefix og eksporter\n\n\nScripts\nTjekker syntax, komprimerer og eksporterer src/js\n\n\nHint\nKører Jshint på backend\n\n\nDefault\nKøres hvis man bare skriver Gulp - Kører styles, script.\n\n\nWatch\nKører styles, scripts, browsersync og en Nodemon server.\n\n\n\nIndledningsvis defineres en Gulp.task, som i eksemplet herunder med scripts.\nDernæst defineres input filerne gulp.src('src/js/**/*.js'). I dette tilfælder omfatter det alle JavaScript filerne, og dermed filerne med endelsen .js i src mappen. Stjernen/asterisk symbolet er her wildcards.\nDernæst tilføjes de omfattede filer til Gulps stream, hver .pipe instancierer dernæst et modul der er importeret i Gulpfilen. Som fx. .pipe(uglify()) der minificerer den importerede kode.\nFor dernæst at compilede, de importeredde filer til pipe(gulp.dest('static/js/')).

Fordelen ved at benytte BSON og dermed også JSON som primær datakilde, er at JSON basalt set er et Javascript object, og dermed arbejder gnindningsfrit med en Javascript baserede applikation som denne.\nI forhold til brugerne af applikationen, vil de derfor blive oprettet i en Users collection.\nDen nedenstående query på denne collection kan køres direkte fra din shell, og vil returnere.

Da et Login via Facebook/Twitter kræver et Username, picture samt socialId er username defineret til at required, unikt samt eventuelle duplikerede username entiteter ikke er tilladt. Da socialId kun benyttes ved oprettelse via disse tjenester er denne value defineret til at være null som udgangspunkt. Ligeledes benyttes password ikke her, så denne værdi er ligeledes defineret til null, da en mangel på denne værdi stadig genererer et validt bruger objekt.\nI tilfældet med brugeroprettelse udelukkende ved brug af username og password. Benyttes derfor username, password samt et generisk profil billede tilføjes ud fra konstanten const DEFAULT_USER_PICTURE der agerer default værdi, så i tilfældet at picture ikke specificeres direkte, vil denne image-path blive tilføjet som værdi.\n    var UserSchema = new Mongoose.Schema({\n        username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, dropDups: true},\n        // Default: null da social ikke behøver password\n        // og alm bruger ikke behover socialId\n        password: { type: String, default: null },\n        socialId: { type: String, default: null },\n        picture:  { type: String, default:  DEFAULT_USER_PICTURE}\n    });\n\nI forhold til Rooms collectionen består denne af to Schemas, det overliggende RoomSchema. Der her indeholder titlen på rummet, samt et array med de forbundne brugere. Samt edet nestede schema MessageSchema der specificerer indholdet af det underliggende MessagesSchema.\nDette schema indeholder ligeledes titel validering.

If you’re familiar with other VCS systems such as Subversion, you’ll notice that the command is clone and not checkout. This is an important distinction — Git receives a copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down when you run git clone. In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can use any of the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned (you may lose some server-side hooks and such, but all the versioned data would be there — see Chapter 4 for more details).\nYou clone a repository with git clone [url]. For example, if you want to clone the Ruby Git library called Grit, you can do so like this:\n$ git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git\nThat creates a directory named grit, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new grit directory, you’ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used. If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than grit, you can specify that as the next command-line option:\n$ git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git mygrit\nThat command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called mygrit.\nGit has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous example uses the git:// protocol, but you may also see http(s):// or user@server:/path.git, which uses the SSH transfer protocol.

If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\nThis means you have a clean working directory — in other words, no tracked files are modified. Git also doesn’t see any untracked files, or they would be listed here. Finally, the command tells you which branch you’re on. For now, that is always master, which is the default; you won’t worry about it here. The next chapter will go over branches and references in detail.\nLet’s say you add a new file to your project, a simple README file. If the file didn’t exist before, and you run git status, you see your untracked file like so:\n$ vim README\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n        README\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\nYou can see that your new README file is untracked, because it’s under the “Untracked files” heading in your status output. Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn’t have in the previous snapshot (commit); Git won’t start including it in your commit snapshots until you explicitly tell it to do so. It does this so you don’t accidentally begin including generated binary files or other files that you did not mean to include. You do want to start including README, so let’s start tracking the file.\n"},"Git/git-ignore.html":{"url":"Git/git-ignore.html","title":"Git Ignore","keywords":"","body":"Ignoring Files\nOften, you’ll have a class of files that you don’t want Git to automatically add or even show you as being untracked. These are generally automatically generated files such as log files or files produced by your build system. In such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named .gitignore.  Here is an example .gitignore file:\n$ cat .gitignore\n*.[oa]\n*~\nThe first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in .o or .a — object and archive files that may be the product of building your code. The second line tells Git to ignore all files that end with a tilde (~), which is used by many text editors such as Emacs to mark temporary files. You may also include a log, tmp, or pid directory; automatically generated documentation; and so on. Setting up a .gitignore file before you get going is generally a good idea so you don’t accidentally commit files that you really don’t want in your Git repository.\nThe rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:\n\nBlank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.\nStandard glob patterns work.\nYou can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.\nYou can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).\n\nGlob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters; [abc] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (?) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen([0-9]) matches any character in the range (in this case 0 through 9) .\nHere is another example .gitignore file:\n# a comment - this is ignored\n# no .a files\n*.a\n# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above\n!lib.a\n# only ignore the root TODO file, not subdir/TODO\n/TODO\n# ignore all files in the build/ directory\nbuild/\n# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt\ndoc/*.txt\n# ignore all .txt files in the doc/ directory\ndoc/**/*.txt\nA **/ pattern is available in Git since version 1.8.2.\n"},"markdown/titles.html":{"url":"markdown/titles.html","title":"Markdown","keywords":"","body":"Titles\nMarkdown supports two types of headline, but fuck that i'm sticking with this one.\n# This is an H1\n\n## This is an H2\n\n###### This is an H6\nOptionally, you can close the heading.\n# This is an H1 #\n\n## This is an H2 ##\n\n### This is an H3 ######\n\nAdd > to the beginning of a sentence to define it as a quote.\n\nHeaders need space between the hash characters and the text.\nOnly '=' and '-' are accepted for underlining an header.\n\n\n"},"markdown/links.html":{"url":"markdown/links.html","title":"Links","keywords":"","body":"Links\nMarkdown supports two styles of links: inline and reference.\nIn both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].\nTo create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text’s closing square bracket.

There are 4 modes of searching, ranging from \"very magic\" to \"very no magic\". They determine what needs to be escaped with a \\ in your search term. If you just want \"regex on\" or \"regex off\" then always search in Very Magic or Very No Magic mode.\nCheck out the details by running :h \\\\v.\n\nPearl style regexes (Very Magic Mode)\nStart a search with \\v. Everything else can act like a normal regex search, except you have to escape / and \\. If you are searching backwards, you’ll also have to escape ?.\n\nE.g. search for a url starting with www and ending with .com: \\vwww\\..*\\.com\n\nDifferences from Pearl Regex\nThe  and > characters are special for start and end of word. Escape them to search for them literally.\nLiteral Search (Very No Magic Mode)\nStart a search with \\V. Now you only have to escape / and \\. It would be nice if you didn't have to escape anything, but alas vim is not like this.\nAdvanced: Match a subsection of your search\nLet's say you have this file\nwww.yahoo.com\nblah some other stuff\nwww.google.com\nwww.ebay.org\nAnd you want to change it to\nwww.chase.com\nblah some other stuff\nwww.chase.com\nwww.chase.org\nWhat you're doing is saying find all domain names and change the inner part to chase. You can do this by specifying the part of the search to match.\nPut \\zs before where you want to match and \\ze after where you want to match.\nSo in this case: \\v www\\. \\zs .* \\ze \\.com\n\nAn extension to this is looking for the start of a word without matching it. For example looking for the variable i. We could then use this search: \\v\\W\\zsi\\ze\\W. Note: Use \\W matches everything except [a-zA-Z0-9_]\nThere’s a shortcut called word boundaries, with  and >:\n\\v (More info)\nYou can get this same behavior by pressing * in normal mode, while having your cursor over the word you want to search.\n\n\n\n\n\nFaster Search and Replace\n\nVim 7.4 has an amazing \"gn\" command that allows you to search and replace faster. gn means \"select the next search term\".\n\nVim Cheat Sheet\nMy collection of vim tips to make the best editor even better.
