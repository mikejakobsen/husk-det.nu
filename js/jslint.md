##JSLint

JSLint is a **code quality tool** for JavaScript which checks your syntax.

Having read through this appendix (you can read more about [JSLint here](http://www.jslint.com)), I tend more towards [**_JSHint_**](http://jshint.com/about/), a _fork_ of JSLint. It allows programmers to customise for themselves which the good parts and bad parts are and define their own subset, although naturally there are a number of pre-defined options. [This is a really fantastic article on using JSHint](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-jshint); it's simple and aimed at having you using JSHint in a few minutes as well as providing various sources for pre-defined subsets.
