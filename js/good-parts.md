##Good Parts

[Javascript: The Good Parts Slideshow](http://gnab.github.io/js-workshop/#1)

> Most programming languages contain good parts and bad parts. I discovered that I could be a better programmer by using only the good parts and avoiding the bad parts. After all, how can you build something good out of bad parts?

The best parts of Javascript include:
* functions
* loose typing (variables are declared as variables, without a type)
* dynamic objects
* object literal notation (where you can create an object already with a list of key/value pairs inside curly braces)

The worst parts include global variables - there is a common _global object_ namespace where they're all lumped together and they're essential to the language.

Javascript has a _class free_ object makeup, relying instead on objects inheriting properties directly from other objects - this is **prototypal inheritance**.
