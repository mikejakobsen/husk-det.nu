### Git status

Mapped to **leader+gs**

The :Gstatus command opens a status window. The contents closely resemble the output from running git status in the shell, but fugitive makes the window interactive. You can jump directly between files with ctrl-n and ctrl-p.

	| Command | Effect                                |
	|---------|---------------------------------------|
	| -       | Add/reset file                        |
	| Enter   | Open current file                     |
	| p       | run `git add â€“patch` for current file |
	| c       | invoke :Gcommit                       |

### Git index

The git index is where you put changes that you want to be included in the next commit.
