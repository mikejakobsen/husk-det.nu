The original vi is a visual extension of an editor called ex, itself an evolution of the editors em and ed. 
The single-keystroke commands used in the visual mode of the ex 
editor were mappings to something that could be done with the command mode of ex.
It’s therefore not quite right to say that vi evolved from ex; they’re the same program,
differing only by invocation name and default mode.
