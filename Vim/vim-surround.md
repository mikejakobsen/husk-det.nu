* DS -> Delete surrounding
* DST -> Delete surrounding tag

It's easiest to explain with examples.  Press `cs"'` inside

    "Hello world!"

to change it to

    'Hello world!'

Now press `cs'<q>` to change it to

    <q>Hello world!</q>

To go full circle, press `cst"` to get

    "Hello world!"

*Delete surrounding*

To remove the delimiters entirely, press `ds"`.

    Hello world!

Now with the cursor on "Hello", press `ysiw]` (`iw` is a text object).

    [Hello] world!

Let's make that braces and add some space (use `}` instead of `{` for no
space): `cs]{`

    { Hello } world!

Now wrap the entire line in parentheses with `yssb` or `yss)`.

    ({ Hello } world!)

Revert to the original text: `ds{ds)`

    Hello world!

Emphasize hello: `ysiw<em>`

    <em>Hello</em> world!

Finally, let's try out visual mode. Press a capital V (for linewise
visual mode) followed by `S<p class="important">`.

    <p class="important">
      <em>Hello</em> world!
    </p>

This plugin is very powerful for HTML and XML editing, a niche which
currently seems underfilled in Vim land.  (As opposed to HTML/XML
*inserting*, for which many plugins are available).  Adding, changing,
and removing pairs of tags simultaneously is a breeze.

The `.` command will work with `ds`, `cs`, and `yss` if you install
[repeat.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat).
