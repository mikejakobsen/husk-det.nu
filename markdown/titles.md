# Titles

Markdown supports two types of headline, but fuck that i'm sticking with this one.

```
# This is an H1

## This is an H2

###### This is an H6
```


Optionally, you can close the heading.

```
# This is an H1 #

## This is an H2 ##

### This is an H3 ######
```

Add > to the beginning of a sentence to define it as a quote.

> Headers need space between the hash characters and the text.


> Only '=' and '-' are accepted for underlining an header.
