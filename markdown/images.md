# Images

```markdown
# Inline
![Alternative text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")

# Reference
![Alternative text][id]
[id]: url/to/image  "Optional title"
```
Images in  Markdown are very similar to links. The difference is that:

* The square brackets must be prefixed with an exclamation mark and
* Inside they may have some alternative text. A description of the image, which is displayed if the image can't be loaded.

> Images must be prefixed with an exclamation mark.
The alternative text and a title are optional.


> Similarly to links, images can have 3 parts: the alternative text, the url and a title. An exclamation mark is nesessary.
