* Structure – How will the pieces of this site be put together? Also knows as composition.

* Content – What will be displayed on the site? (User research informs you.)

* Informational hierarchy – How and where is information organized and displayed? Why?

* Functionality – What can this interface do? What happens when I push this button?

* Behavior – How does it interact with the user? How does it behave? What will the UX be.

1. Gather information about users to inform you choices.
2. Work with a clear picture of your product’s users and their goals (persona, scenario, task models, user journeys).
3. Work with a clear understanding of the business goals for the project (stakeholder interviews, requirements workshops).
4. Have a content strategy, including priorities an information architecture. Have early ideas (from ideation workshops or sketching sessions)
