# Designing Behavior and Form

## Design Values

  * Ethical (considerate, helpful)
  	>	Do no harm
  		Improve human situations
  * Purposeful (useful, usable)
  > Help users achieve their goals and aspirations
  	Accommodate user contexts and capacities
  * Pragmatic(viable,feasible)
  > Help commissioning organizations achieve their goals
  	Accommodate business and technical requirements
  * Elegant (effcient, artful, affective)
  > Represent the simplest complete solution
  	Possess internal (self-revealing, understandable) coherence
  	Appropriately accommodate and stimulate cognition and emotion

## Purposeful interaction design

The behavior patterns you observe and communicate should describe your users’ strengths as well as their weaknesses and blind spots.

Goal-Directed Design helps designers create products that support users where they are weak and empower them where they are strong.


One of the classic elements of good design is economy of form: using less to accomplish more. In interface design, this means using *only the screens and widgets necessary to accomplish the task.*

## Principles operate at different levels of detail


* Conceptual principles help define what digital products should be like and how they fit structurally into the broad context of use required by their users.
* Behavioral principles describe how a product should behave—in general and in specific contexts.
* Interface-level principles describe effective strategies for the organization
